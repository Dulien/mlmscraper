Leaving WFG after giving them my hard earned $400. Is there any way that my bank (scotiabank) can help me?,"Good day!

I‚Äôm new on this sub and currently living in Canada for almost a year and a half now.

To start, I am an international student from the Philippines and I am currently on work permit working at a fast food restaurant as a supervisor, so basically my salary is enough for me to survive for the next paycheck plus I do save like around $100-$200 every cutoff which I strictly put to my savings account for rainy days and for my PR application fees for the future. I also have a second job as a inventory associate for retail stores to get more hours.

So this started when my cousin who is here in Canada for almost 6-7 years now asked if we can set up a zoom meeting because she told me that she will teach me how to file my taxes (in which she did not). So on that meeting, she first introduced World Finance Group (WFG) and their history blabla how their business works and their products/services etc. Then after that, she told me that the reason why most people want to own a business here in Canada is to have their taxes written off which as an agent you can get your taxes written off for acquiring a business code. So I said yeah sure I am down to get my taxes written off but she told me that I need to pay $150 before taxes for me to earn a business code which I payed. 

After paying, I did some research about WFG where I read a lot of bad reviews and that I can commit tax fraud if I continue so for our second meeting she told me that I need to purchase an online course which is around $200 (Oliver‚Äôs Learning LLQP Pre-licensing Bundle) for me to be licensed so that I can use my business code legally, in which she didn‚Äôt mention in the first place. So around that time I just agreed to pay the $200 so that no money would be wasted (In which I was wrong. I should‚Äôve just let that $150 away)

But since I am working two jobs, my second job promoted me as a supervisor so basically I am working 2 supervisory position which is stressful but I don‚Äôt mind as long as it is honest money. But now I don‚Äôt have time to do the courses and I heard that there is a lot of hidden charges ahead if I continue with WFG. 

I honestly regret the day that I was introduced with them. It‚Äôs not a lot of money but that $400 means a lot to me because I am trying to save so hard for rainy days that I can‚Äôt even repair or replace my glasses since it is expensive here and it‚Äôs been two years already. I can‚Äôt even buy a new non-slip shoes for my work but all I know is that $400 is now a lesson but I‚Äôm still trying my luck.

Tldr: Was introduced to WFG about writing my taxes off that continued to purchasing their online courses and now I want out. Can my bank issuer help me?

Btw sorry for my english guys. It‚Äôs not my native tongue",7,12,Help/Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/qvhp17/leaving_wfg_after_giving_them_my_hard_earned_400/
Anyone ever get scammed by people from Ambit energy?,"At first I felt so guilty for cutting off my former best ‚Äúfriend‚Äù after he scammed me out of 100 dollars when I tried to become a rep, doing literally everything he did, and not one person wanted to be a customer. So this guy took total advantage of me. And I bet his wife had a hand in guilting his family into becoming his customers too. 

But everyone I know agrees I did the right thing. The fact that he passive aggressively referred to me as his FORMER best friend, even in an Ambit group on Facebook, says all I need to know about him as well!

Kirby Vacuum Salesman Lies About Needing a Place to Stay and Gives the Worst Sales Pitch," 

To keep it brief: I‚Äôm a college student living in Norfolk, Virginia with 2 other friends who're college students. The neighborhood I‚Äôm in is pretty rough and Norfolk itself is a pretty rough city, but I like to help out people whenever I can. Am I na√Øve? Maybe. I just like to aid whoever needs help.

A 6'5""-6'6"" (general estimate, for reference I'm 6'1 and he was towering above me) Kirby Vacuum Salesman comes up to the front door asking if he could stay here until his brother picked him up to go back home to North Carolina. He said it‚Äôd be short and seeing as I didn‚Äôt want him in harms way, I took him in, even though my gut had me feeling otherwise. He asked me my name and I, unconsciously, gave him my first name. He asked if I was Muslim and I replied ""no it's a Hindi name"" and he goes ""Muslim, Hinduism, same shit"". I just replied with ""no not really"" but let him in anyways because he seemed alright enough.

We sat on the living room couch and he was asking about if we could play Call of Duty on my PS4 and I was like ""I don't really have PS plus, I just use the PS4 for watching stuff"". I asked him questions like 'how long are you going to be waiting', 'what do you do' etc and the guy goes ""so because I'm a man with dreads, you think I'm gonna rob you? Why are you asking all these questions man?"". I have really bad anxiety, especially with letting strangers into my house. Why did I do this? Idk I wanted to be a good Samaritan but the guy seemed shadier and shadier with the more he talked. So I replied with the truth. ""I just got anxiety man"" and he goes ""Me too. I was waiting for 2 hours before knocking on your door"". I nodded but I was looking around just because I felt like a panic attack was coming up.

I actually told him of a non-existent friend that would be willing to let him crash for a night and he said ""Nah man I just need a ride"". I also offered to pay for an Uber/Lyft since I originally assumed he lived in Norfolk or Hampton Roads in general, but the guy goes ""No man I need to go to North Carolina"" so that idea quickly died.

He switched topics and talked about how he had college hoes (despite him being 41) and he was talking about how they like to clean. He pointed at the hallway and was like ""See? You like to clean right?"" I was like 'uh yeah, sure'. He talks about some metaphor about borrowing my hypothetical car and asking if I let him borrowed it, would it be my fault if he crashed it. I originally said ""it'd be your fault"" and he was like ""No man! It'd be your fault because you let me borrow it!"". Afterwards, he talked about doing something right for me by ""repaying"" me and that I should give him my social security number, phone number, address, and first and last name.

I was very fucking confused. I got a pen and some paper and wrote a fake name, fake phone number, and I was gonna write a fake social security number but then I decided against it. His partner arrived and we both left the building. His partner parked behind the building but he got upset for some reason even though it was legit a minute walk. Then his partner randomly drove off and the Salesman got annoyed.

The guy kept asking me if I had a social security number and I bullshitted and said ""Actually I'm a student migrant on a visa"" despite being a US citizen. He got upset and was like ""so do you have numbers on it?"" and I just bullshitted and said ""Idk the numbers, I don't have my visa with me it's with my parents"" and he got annoyed. He kept pushing me to give him something and I kept telling him ""I don't have a social security number or a green card man, I'm just a foreign student"".

We went back to the apt door and my 2 roommates opened it. He sat down on the couch and gave one of the worst sales pitches ever.

He complimented everybody by calling us ""smart college kids"" and then talked about an ""opportunity"" for us: paying 25 cents a day for a fucking Kirby vacuum. He told us how we could get a vacuum to clean up our apt and one of my roommates was like ""but we don't own this building. We just rent it and we don't really care about it"". The guy was annoyed and kept pushing it on us and we all just said ""nah"". He got angry and said ""so y'all can't spend 25 cents a day?"" and we all just said we have utilities, rent, and groceries to pay. His partner eventually found our apartment and he was pretty alright, he popped in for like 30 seconds and was an older guy like around his mid to late 50s, asking the other guy if he's gonna get in the ride or not. After offering us the vacuum again, we all said no and he left.

My roommates and I laughed it off since I invited a literal vacuum salesman into our home, but it was definitely stressful for me. Like yeah it was just a salesman and it was my own fault for letting a complete stranger into my home, but Jesus my anxiety was riding really high once he started asking for my personal info out of nowhere. He vaguely talked about his college hoes cleaning and then all of a sudden talks about ""repaying"" me. I have too big of a heart, but not big enough to just give somebody personal information for no reason. Overall, the guy stayed in our apartment for about an hour and 15 minutes but Jesus fuck it was stressful being with him alone before my roommates came in.

TL;DR I messed up by inviting a salesman (who could've been anybody else) into my home to wait for a ride and he gave the most awkward sales pitch ever.

A friend almost convinced me with Amway/URA,"Ok, this was was a tough one. So, first of all, I received a text from a friend of mine saying how I would benefit from a mentor. I was intrigued by it, said yes, and met this so-called mentor first thing he ask me how do I envision my life for eight years how do I want to live. I told him my dream lifestyle blah blah then he tried to schedule another meeting fine I proceeded with that meeting and got invited to be exposed to other mentees in that meeting. They finally talked about Amway and URA. I was highly skeptical, so I went ahead and started to do some research and found nothing but negativity regarding this MLM and what they did to me. They do it to everyone else; at that moment, I knew I wanted out but stayed a little longer to find out more information. Here comes the next meeting where the ""mentor"" tells me the exact details it costs $180 to start, then $50 a month to heat motivational crap that's useless, then four annual meetings which you must attend pay for food, hotel, etc. and they want you to have at least % three return which is about $300 a month. At that point, I was like, ok, I am running as far as I can from this. I messaged them, making up a story of how my mom is in the hospital, and I can't focus on this now. To my surprise, they attacked me deemed me unworthy, and I did not pass their trial phase; the funniest part for me is that I told them I did not want to be a part of this in the text, but they managed to flip the script and say it's my fault hahahahhaha so funny. Everyone be safe from these BS scams out there URA/Amway complete BS

Praying on people in need,"Hi huns!

I joined to have a laugh sometimes, because MLMs make no sense. 

Brace yourselves: This story is detailed, but it's exactly how I felt talking to the Hun.

In april 2018 I finally left my abusive boss. I was  a student, still making my study plans, and wandering if it was smart to study drama as a free choice subject. I met a drama student in other circumstances, and I wanted to get coffee with her and discuss about the subject. I foolishly mentioned what went wrong with my boss...

""I'm so sorry! I really have something for you"". I was guilt-tripped AF, even if my parents reassured me, I wanted to find a job quickly. I rolled my eyes at the privilege when she chose one of the most expensive caf√©s to get coffee. ""I have a great opportunity for you! You can work from home, you just have to recruit and market on SoMe, it's wonderful for students"" ""Oh, a private company. Do you guys need my CV? What kind of competence are you looking for?"". \*stupid me\*

""Oh, it's just a small buisness. We are into direct sales"". It sounded so interesting. A small buisness, I like small buisnesses. I like working environments where you are rather delivering a quality product than getting high on competition or workaholism while you sell low quality crap. She started talking about ""direct sails"", and ""You know, those shady pyramid schemes are illegal and unfair because the boss gets all the money and bla bla bla"". So far, so good. I couldn't but agree. Why working for somebody that takes all the profit for themselves while other people work hard for nothing? Why having a complicated sails system? Right? Even if I've never felt like a pushy promoter, I was interested. ""So, where is this small buisness in the city? Can I go and meet the manager?"". Yup. Since she described it as a small buisness, I imagined a shop that also has something going on on the net, and since she didn't mention the product, I wanted to see the shop and have a second opinion on what kind of salesperson and recruiter they were looking for. Just to make sure I was competent enough for them. 

""Yeah, there is a selling point here, but we work online. If you subscribe and pay me so and so, I will get you recruited and you will work from home. You decide the hours, you will make money! The more people you get involved, the more ...."". OK. Now it sounds more complicated. And, why should I pay her to work? Why so much? 

""Mmmh... I'm currently struggling a little bit with money. Not sure if I can help. I need to think about it"" ""OK, but please join, you will make a lot of money, it's a great opportunity, working on Social Media...."". My interest in the thing went imediately downhill. Not worth the trouble, of course.

Next time we met: ""Have you made up your mind?"" ""Mmmh... I confess I'm not sure. I like to work in small environments. Face to face with people. That buisness... I don't know"" ""You can buy a so and so package and sign up to the course. It's in the luxury hotel, a guy will be there and explain it all. You will be sooooo motivated to sell and recruit. Buy so and so...."". Seriously, why should an unemployed person pay to get trained after recruiting? And why can't I meet anybody else from the company? And why is it so difficult to know WTF are we selling? Jeez! Are we selling mops? Are we selling nappies? Are we selling Unicorns? Say *something*! 

""Now it's just me and my friend selling beauty products, but if you join..."" ""OK. You said *direct sales*. Who is *making* the beauty products? Does your friend have a lab? Do you need help with making?"" ""No, we only sell online"" ""So, this is not direct sales. It's just sales"" -when being a basic bitch like me is actually a weapon-

Hun starts drawing a scheme again: ""You see, this sells to this, that recruits this, that sells to this..."" ""Exactly what I was talking about. Sell, resell, resell... it's so complicated, it is not a small buisness. It's as unfair and domplicated as it can be. I can find a job at a big supermarket chain, if I must"". She went pale. ""No, if you buy this package from my friend Thingey and go to the luxury hotell this weekend"" ""Thanks. Sorry, I really have to go"".

When even an unexperienced student thinks that paying to get a job is bullshit.

I come to you as a former hun,"Apologies in advance, this is gonna be a long post, but I feel like I need to share. Tldr at the end. 

Last year I (f26) was roped into joining an mlm. 

I actually run my own business with my SO (we do gemstone manufacturing), and last year when rona hit, like most other businesses, we were hit hard. In our country, we could reopen our business at level 4, but our jewellers could only open at level 3, so we spent about 3 months with no income, and then a further 2 months of little income because, understandably, people were prioritising buying food over jewellery.

A ""friend"" of mine reached out during our first lockdown and asked me if I was interested in getting a second income. Honestly, I was so stressed about my SO and I not being able to pay bills (I was still paying off a student loan at the time) so I thought why not!

Now, at the time, I had never heard of this company. She set up a Zoom meeting with her ""partner"" in the business and they explained how amazing it is and that they were able to make money from home and help so many people with the products they sell.

Now, I like to think that I'm a relatively smart person (obviously not THAT smart apparently), and the way they explained the business ""position"" was that I would basically be a sales person, so I jumped at the opportunity because sales is my forte!

It started with the toothpaste (I'm sure you know which company I'm referring to now), then the other products. When I didn't make a lot of sales from the toothpaste, I had a Zoom meeting set up with my upline's upline's upline, and she started telling me to buy the products as a way of ""encouraging"" myself to make more sales. After all, if I buy the products, I have to sell them! I started asking friends and family for help, asking them to ask their colleagues to buy from me. They were all very encouraging but no one wanted to buy. I felt like a failure, not just to myself, but to my SO because I couldn't provide for us.

Then I was encouraged to use any earnings I made to purchase the most expensive product (the lumi) in order to ""prove"" to potential customers how amazing it was. Only then (yeah I know) did I start to realise what was happening. I tried convincing myself it wasn't what I was starting to think it was. When our actual business finally started making decent income again, I told myself I'd just sell the products on the side. Then it started taking over my Sundays where I had to attend virtual seminars, then every Monday and Wednesday morning, until eventually I couldn't even do the work I needed to for my own business.

So I stopped selling the products. I was honest and told them I just couldn't do both jobs. They said anything and everything they could to get me to stay, but I stood my ground.

Looking back now, woooooow, I cannot believe I fell for it all. The friend that roped me in doesn't even talk to me anymore. I feel so horrible for roping in the other girls that I did and lying to them about wanting to work with them because they were so great, when now I don't even talk to them either, I literally just used them like I was used.

Anyway, my business is way more successful now than it ever has been, so I have no regrets! Also, I LOVE this group because it reminds me of how naive I was only a year ago and some of these posts remind me of myself.

My college roommate,"Im so glad I found this page!

A few years ago, I reconnected with a roommate from college that I hadnt seen in about 16 years.. 

A bit of back story. She was a NIGHTMARE in college. A spoiled little girl who was only living in the dorms and even attending college because mommy and daddy wouldnt keep buying her things if she didnt.  She would stay up all night crying on the phone with her boyfriend and then go crying to the RA in the morning when I would have to get up and get ready for classes because I was ""keeping her awake.""  Spent hours in the bathroom, never cleaned and used to fill MY refrigerator with her stuff. I was so glad when that year ended and I was able to transfer to a different dorm.

Years later when she found me on facebook, I figured she would have grown up.  Nope. She hadnt.

And thats when the Lularoe plugs started. I must have gotten a 100 invites a day to join in on her ""virtual parties."" Every single post was about her ""new business."" It was FAR too much. 

Or so I thought. One day, she posted a long story about how her grandfather was dying, how much she loved him, how much he inspired her and how ""Life was too short."".....

‚ÄúMultilevel Marketing‚Äù Companies Cheat and Exploit Ordinary People on a Vast Scale,"Jacobin: 

""So-called multilevel marketing (MLM) schemes have been around for decades, and for almost as long as they‚Äôve existed, they‚Äôve carried a pungent whiff of fraud. But as author and longtime MLM expert Robert FitzPatrick argues, the industry has only grown in size and influence since its inception ‚Äî remaining a poorly understood and criminally underregulated enterprise that generates billions in revenue every year while scamming countless Americans. 

As FitzPatrick notes, MLM has eluded not only the wrath of law enforcement, but also the scrutiny of investigative journalists and the critiques of progressive advocacy and activism ‚Äî despite extracting billions of dollars from millions of people each year and well-established ties to the political right. 

Jacobin‚Äôs Luke Savage sat down with FitzPatrick for a wide-ranging conversation about the history, scale, and structure of MLMs, and why there‚Äôs no such thing as a legitimate MLM.""

I Wasn't Even 18,"I've wanted to share this story for awhile now but whenever I tell it to people they don't really seem to get why it made me feel so weird and uncomfortable.

I used to work in-person retail, this took place during 2016. I worked mostly the cash register since I'm a social butterfly and good at having conversations with customers. 

An older woman comes through my line and idk what started it, maybe I was just being nice, or maybe I was genuine but I remember remarking how I liked her lipstick. Cue her pulling about fifty packets worth of lotions, perfume samples, etc and shoving them at me, explaining she was an Avon rep and they're always looking for people.

I was 17. I certainly did not look like an adult so it was already weird to kinda put the pressure on a kid. I took the stuff with a smile to be nice and rung her up and she left. Pretty sure I threw it all in the garbage after because it smelled weird lol.

I thought that was the end of my interaction. EXCEPT SOMEHOW, I started getting texts from her regarding Avon sales, and how to be a rep and ""have your own business."" 

I couldn't figure out how she got my number, so I essentially did a reverse Google search of me to see where I screwed up. The only logical way she could have done this is looked up my name (which where I worked, only had the first initial and the last name on the receipt and my last name is not unique) found me on Facebook by narrowing it down to the fact I had put on my profile where I worked, and she had to continually scroll until she found ONE POST I had made back in like 2013 where I had posted a question about a fucking middle school dance and put my phone number in there. It was one of the only posts I ever made that wasn't private because I was 14 and stupid when I made it.

She never stopped texting me. Ever. About twice a week I would get something. I never replied but she wouldn't stop, and at 17, blocking the number of a person you lived in a small town with who had seen your face seemed scary. I finally got my number changed after getting a new phone and stopped getting texts. 

But I'll never get over how weird and predatory that was. My birthday is DEFINITELY on Facebook so she had to have known I was underage. To this day even thinking of Avon makes me feel gross.

Lesson learned: make sure all your social media is private or unidentifying. Or you might get a Hun in your DMs for over three years.",5,106,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/qo1uxz/i_wasnt_even_18/

He made it seem like they would like buy low priced stuff on websites and sell it for higher on other sites like amazon. I was a bit interested so I met with him today. He‚Äôs actually going to be a speaker at what seems to be an Amway LTD rally in a few moments.

Devil corp experience,"I found a link to information about the ‚ÄúDevil Corp‚Äù on this sub earlier, and now I finally know the answer to something that has been gnawing at me for the last 12 years. 

It was 2009. I was home from college for the summer and having extreme difficulty finding a seasonal job. Out of pure desperation to get out of my parents‚Äô house and earn some money for the next semester, I responded to a shady looking Craigslist ad for ‚Äúmarketing reps‚Äù against my better judgement.  No company name, no actual job description, you know the drill. 

I went through the interview process and sure enough, they sucked me in with their ‚Äúhip‚Äù office decor and young, outgoing staff. I accepted the job without having any idea what it actually entailed. 

For my first day they had me train with this bubbly college dropout. We met at the office and she drove me to her ‚Äúterritory‚Äù which was about an hour away. I was so wrapped up in chatting and getting to know her on the drive over that once again, the job duties never came up. Finally she parked the car. We got out, she opened her trunk, and showed me boxes of framed prints. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to sell these. Grab some.‚Äù 

I was totally confused but grabbed a bunch of prints and followed her into a retail store. Then to my horror, I watched her cheerfully try - and fail - to sell prints to *every single person* in the store. I could feel my face turning red with embarrassment, but she wasn‚Äôt fazed by any of it. We walked out and I followed her inside the business right next door, where the exact same thing happened. We did this for a full 8 hours. She even barged through a *nursing home.* I wanted to run but I was in an unfamiliar area and my car was not accessible so I had to stick it out. 

After 8 hours we had sold an impressive grand total of 2 prints. One to a poor schlub who worked at Subway, and one to an office receptionist (where we were kicked out of the building immediately following the sale). I believe her commission totaled $40. I didn‚Äôt get a dime and didn‚Äôt care, I just wanted to get the fuck home. 

I played it cool on the drive back. I pretended like I‚Äôd had a great day and couldn‚Äôt wait to go out on my own. This was a survival tactic so she wouldn‚Äôt drop me in the middle of the woods‚Ä¶or worse, because those were the types of vibes I‚Äôd been getting. But I never went back or returned any of their calls after that day. 

For 12 years now I‚Äôve been perplexed as to what the hell this company actually WAS, and now I know.",3,44,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/qky223/devil_corp_experience/
I was told to post this short story here.,"Astaroth gazed around the circle. Black candles rendered from the bloated, suffocating souls of the damned encircled the enormous magical symbol. The infernal runes that blasphemed the universe itself has been carved by his own claws into the black speckled red stones.

He grinned his wickedly fanged maw in anticipation, as he would summon the most terrible fiend of the mortal realm, a being of terrible might, prophesied to bring a terrible, defiling order to the accursed pit of evil.

It was time. He led his own daughter to the circle and slit her throat. The blood poured into the circle and formed blue flames as the candles went out, and a black bonfire began to roar in the center on the circle. He spoke terrible words in a language forbidden to even his kind, curses and profanities so dark that he felt even his rotten soul cry out in terror.

When the final word was spoken, he called out the name of the most terrible of evils.

""Heed my call! Tear this accursed land asunder! I call you, Cae'rin!""

The black flames exploded outward, ripping into all who stood around the circle, and blowing all about.

Astaroth laid bleeding. His limbs were torn and broken, and he barely had the strength to look up. Is... Is that the most vile mortal fiend? No fangs. No claws. Dressed in simple clothes. And... What was that case she held?

The human approached him, and squatted down.

Ziprecruiter almost got me into an MLM,"I've been out of work for a month and I've applied to so many different jobs that I constantly get phone calls and emails about interviews. Yesterday I received a call asking me to come into an interview  for a "" Sales Postion"". Keep in mind when I was eighteen I once fell for a ""Communications Sales"" postion only for it to be an MLM that was selling horrible internet from AT&T and DirecTV packages in a Sam's Club with a unrealistic daily qutoa and almost nonexistent pay. Luckily I was horrible on the first day and they told me to call in a few days if I wanted to come back but I called and said I was no longer interested and they never contacted me again  or paid me for time. After that I had thought I learned my lesson and avoided similar schemes once I realized what they really were.  Now fast forward to  a few days ago,  I was on Ziprecruiter when I was scrolling and accidentally clicked a stupid one touch apply for a ""Sales Position"" but I've only been contacted once from a Ziprecruiter posting so didn't think anything of it. I got a call Yesterday Morning and when I answered it was interesting. 

Hun: Hi, this is ( Guy with an extremely thick accent) from ( I couldn't understand what The ""Businesses"" name was because his accent was thicker than molasses) is this ( My name but with an awful pronunciation of it) .

Me: Yes, this is him

Hun: Great, would you like to come in for an interview we have many open ""Sales Positions"" and we work with many different clients in many different fields.

Me: OK but what does the postion pay and entail? Also what exactly do you do?

Hun: We'll discuss that at the interview. We have many open ""Sales Positions"" and we work with many different clients in many different fields.

Me: You're not answering any of my questions can I speak to someone else who can give me more information. 

Hun: Yes I'm answering your questions, we have many open ""Sales Positions"" and we work with many different clients in many different fields.

Pissed Off Me: Let me guess this is one of those MLM'S where I'll be standing in a Costco  begging people to buy something they don't want buy.

Hun: Yes we do work in Costco for our Clients....

Me:  F-You, Don't ever call this number again. 

I then blocked the number and I know should have just hung up once I couldn't get a straight answer  but I just wanted to see how far I could get and if I could get them to admit it.

Leaving behind toxic positivity and toxic productivity - WWDB,"After lurking, I decided to post. I'm a little nervous because my story is unique and may be easily decipherable, but I don't know where else to talk about this. It's strange how something impacted me in a great way, but also in a terrible way at the same time. This is going to be LONG, but it will probably be an interesting read for you.

TRIGGER WARNING: Suicide and self-harm

A little background: I have severe ADHD and PMDD (and a touch of OCD) that has been untreated for a long time and my MLM experience contributed to this. 

I will be talking about Amway and World Wide Dream Builders 

Was around the business from 18 and left when I was 21, which was half a year ago. I ended high school depressed because I was in and out of psychiatric hospitalization until I finally got to a calm point where I decided to apply to schools half a year after graduating HS and start pursuing my creative interests. 

I met somebody who talked about people who didn't go to college and were wildly successful, so that really caught my attention because I was very very bad at school and anxious because of the pressure to go. So I went through a process and earned mentorship. It was fun at first - I was excited because I felt like my life now had meaning and I had people believing I could be successful, which was one of the good things that came out of the whole experience. Although it didn't help in the long run, it did help me with my mental health in the beginning. Reading self-help books and listening to positivity gave me a mission to follow, which I desperately needed at that time. 

I decided to not go to school and started working full-time to make money for business building and becoming personally responsible. I went through a lot of personal growth getting out of my shyness and gaining self-confidence. 

Now, this has been three years of involvement, so the majority of it was a blur. 

A year into working at a 9-5 job, I became increasingly suicidal and depressed, which unfortunately wasn't abnormal. The thing about PMDD and depression for me was that sometimes I can handle the waves and then there are occasional times where I absolutely can't handle it. I was stressed because somebody I thought I loved left (I have severe attachment issues), and the pressure of 'building the business' which included reading, listening to a positive podcast, sending a message to upline, and finding people who are interested in meeting my mentors. It became unbearable, and I was afraid of talking about it to anyone because I wanted to be a stable person who can become successful. 

One day, something inside me burst and I found myself sitting in my car with a big bottle of pills, crying my eyes out. Note- I've never attempted suicide. I didn't come close to swallowing all of those pills, which will tie into the rest of the story. 

I called my manager, then I called my dad saying I wanted to kill myself right now. Then my dad picked me up from 30 minutes away. I was a mess. 

That night, I went to go out to my church small group who were a very supportive and loving group of friends and talked about what happened. I felt a little better, especially since I didn't want to be alone. I texted my upline something like this:

""I wanted to tell you that today I felt a huge urge to take my life and left work early. I'm trying to get a grip of reality right now, but I may be spotty in responding"" (since we were meant to communicate every day. 

Mind you, work was very important in the WWDB world because it was the way to build personal responsibility and have money to build your business and have a high point volume each month. I always felt really really guilty about not following through with going to work because I didn't want to be seen as lazy or incompetent. 

I can't remember what they said after my text, but over the next few days, I was off from work, sticking to my dad the whole day because, in my safety plan, I always have to be with someone for a while after a breakdown. 

Upline would text things like ""How are you? What are you doing today?"" and I'd tell them I was with dad and going along with him to grocery store"" (for me, I try to do normal daily things to distract me from how I'm feeling)

Then they ask me something like, ""Is it possible that this is a way of getting attention from your dad?"" At that time, that really didn't sound terrible, but I was always doubtful of myself. I know they said this because earlier in our friendship we talked about our dad issues and how they affect us today. I told them that I didn't think so. 

Following that, I had the choice of extending my leave of absence, which I did. Upline texted me, ""when do you go back to work?"" and I said I asked for an extension of a few more days (since it was the end of the week at that time). Then came the reply, ""is that going to help you towards your goals?"" I felt embarrassed and texted back ""no,"" and they said ""you can probably call them and reverse the extension."" I didn't, I kept my extension and pretended that I went back to work the next week. 

I ended up finding another job that was easier and closer to my home, and paid more. I took that job after talking to my upline. I still was depressed and had bad PMDD bouts where I would shut myself in the bathroom and cry for half an hour. But, I needed to make money and I needed to be personally responsible. 

I was still attending board plans and conferences and such. They actually helped me a bit because everyone was positive and encouraging. 

I spent a lot of my free time talking to people about the business and honestly, I was just as burnt out as before my suicidal incident. But I kept going because this was going to be part of my success journey. 

I had a ""mini"" breakdown and asked my upline if I could sit down and talk with them. They said once in a while is fine when it's not involving the business and wanted to make sure I wouldn't ask to sit with them frequently. 

I told them why I thought I was depressed (now I know it was also chemically and hormonally motivated) - sexual assault when I was younger, bad relationships, etc. They responded with how in their neighborhood growing up, there was a lot worse sexual abuse going on, and people do overcome it if they continue to grow. I wasn't sure if I was encouraged, but I believed that I could just get over the ""junk"" in my life. 

It's always encouraged to reach upline for help with anything - emotionally, physically, business-wise, financially. Nearly every time I had urges to self-harm or suicidal ideation, I would send a voice message upline, crying. I said things like, ""I feel like I really want to cut myself, etc. I don't know how to get through this."" The responses from them would be ""don't listen to your emotions and feelings, focus on your goals, this negativity probably means you're not getting enough positive input."" I didn't think that was unreasonable at the time.

One time I was talking with them on another occasion about suicidality and depression, they said that they knew people who actually killed themselves and what that looks like. I also got, ""I don't think you're suicidal, I think you're just not following through with your goals,"" and ""If you're suicidal, why haven't you killed yourself yet?"" - and then peppering in how everybody has suicidal thoughts pass their mind, and they're just thoughts. 

Now I believe that they're not just thoughts. They're dangerous desires I felt compulsed to fantasize about. 

This upline has had their own experience with depression and anxiety and has chalked it up to not having a life purpose or positive influence in life. They said that in building the business and mentoring people, they overcame those issues and are now free from them. They were also vocal about how psychiatric medications are a farce and don't do anything good. 

Another head-heaving aspect of all this was regarding my new partner. There's this mentality in WWDB that you are allowed to do whatever you want, but the wrong decisions will not bring you to success. So, my conscience would constantly be on overdrive and feel so guilty when I wasn't doing the right things according to the leaders. Note, they never told people what to do, but encouraged them to believe that some things will not help you grow and be serious about building. 

I met this amazing, goofy person at my work and started dating. I didn't tell upline until I felt guilty about it and ""confessed"" later. Why did I feel guilty? There's this belief within the community that you will have the best life if you have a partner that is ambitious and is on the same page with the business. This person I was dating had different goals than mine, but I brushed that aside because of how much of a compassionate person they were. 

As I thought, I was asked if what I wanted in life was someone who may not be as ambitious as I was and how it might cause heartbreak in the future. I truly truly believe that upline was saying this with a tender heart, but it caused a lot of confusion for me. 

Everytime they asked about my partner and when I'm going to have the conversation to see if he would appreciate meeting my upline, it would hurl me in an anxious spiral. Why couldn't I just let my partner be themselves and just continue with what I was doing? It wasn't like upline was saying I can't be with this person, just asking questions that made me think about it like, ""this relationship may slow you down from your big goals."" 

Now, I hadn't pursued therapy or psychiatric help during all of this time because I hung on to how I should be able to overcome my mental health issues by following through and focusing on the business. I wanted to be a good example, and follow what upline did, which included ditching a therapist after earning partnership with successful entrepreneurs. 

I wasn't explicitly discouraged from going to therapy or seeking help, but there were comments of how negativity in life means you're not following through with building the business or are not close enough to upline. 

I also forgot to mention, I was considering going to a therapy residential or inpatient program because of my terrible ups and downs with my depression. I felt so guilty about even considering it because it meant taking a break from building the business and it would show I just wasn't committed enough. 

It finally got to me when every time upline texted me, it was anxiety-inducing. It was hard to have a normal text conversation most of the time because there was always some kind of checking up on me. In WWDB, (and I understand where they come from with this because I agree to some extent that if you want to be wildly successful, you have to sacrifice a lot of comforts), you're discouraged from social media, downtime, reading non personal growth books ( I loved to read fiction but gave that up for a while because I couldn't read them without guilt), casually hanging out with friends, wasting time, drink, party, go on vacations, spending too much time with non-ambitious people, watching TV, listening to music. 

Texts would sometimes be like ""what are you up to?"" and I'd lie and be like ""oh, I'm out talking to people"" When I was really in bed scrolling on reddit or something. Or, I would text them a video of kids I was babysitting saying hi - and the second time I did it, upline would ask ""is this the only job you're doing right now?"" Just felt like I couldn't be myself but also I wasn't confident enough to speak how I really felt, which is why I feel like it went on for so long. 

I finally decided to get psychiatric medication and oh my gosh... I hadn't felt that clear in like, ever. It was amazing. It was my answer. I was able to get a better look at my situation and realized I decided to build the business because I was depressed and life had no meaning, and it felt like the only thing that gave my life purpose. But, my medication made me feel that I had a purpose and I had no reason to do things that sapped me. I decided I wanted to pursue my lifelong dream of journalism and beyond. 

I left abruptly. I get nervous whenever I get a text from them and feel a little bad because I basically ghosted. I just can't talk to them without them trying to get me to see that my situation is fixable through the business and such. I just can't.

"Storytime: A short conversation with a young USANA Hun (and ended up rejecting her ""invitation"")","Hello, wherever you are!

You may noticed me commenting on every other posts in this subreddit, and I've decided to share my own story about my experience with an MLM. As they say in Spanish, *sin m√°s dilaci√≥n*:

More than half a decade ago (either five or six years earlier), I was on my way home from applying for a job in a call center in the Philippine city of Lipa (the company in question, by the way, is TeleTech, whose global corporate headquarters is in Colorado, near the MLM epicenter), riding through a *jeepney* (a common form of public transportation here) when I blurted out on my relatively problematic blood pressure, as I was totally sedentary at that time, because such problem runs in both sides of my family as I took a tablet of maintenance medicine and drank a bottle of water.

Suddenly, a female student younger than me noticed on my then health condition and initiated a conversation with me. She was quite nice, I noticed,  and I quickly learned that she was studying at the same college that I've attended years before, and that was before the full implementation of K to 12 (also known as the appearance of Senior High School) in the country. 

After the short introductory chat with her, the student revealed to me that she's actually a brand representative of USANA, explaining that one of her company's supplements could actually combat hypertension, which was quite too good to be true, I now realized. As our conversation progressed further, she nicely explained (or should I say boasted?) that the headquarters of USANA Philippines in Makati had occupied a single floor of one of those skyscrapers there, and revealed that the local branch of USANA is located in the building just in front of the college that I've attended for four years. In the end, she asked to write my mobile number as she invited me to attend of their ""meetings"" the following day, which I thought it was quite sudden, but I ended up giving her my digits, because I thought it was rude to refuse her upfront.

The following day, I just received her text message, checking me if I'd go to her ""meeting"". I never replied, because the distance between Lipa and my hometown is greater and public transportation costs could significantly eat up my pocket money. Just a waste of time and money, in short.

 Looking from today's perspective, I realized that the decision of not attending an USANA ""meeting"" was correct, because I don't really imagine myself losing my soul (as well my own money and time), as I always commented in every other posts here.

I hope you enjoyed reading my story, despite my level of English (üòÖ) and the period that lapsed. 

Take care, wherever you are!

**TL;DR**: Had a conversation with a young female student on my way home from a job hunt; she turned up to be an USANA Hun, inviting me to attend their ""meeting"".

Pressured to join Rodan & Fields,"
I was one of those kids who almost got suckered into the Vector Marketing scam when I graduated high school in the US. 

More recently, somebody in my family back in the US has pressured me to join Rodan & Fields since they expanded to Japan.

Even worse, they were pressuring me in to join mid-pandemic when I already experienced job loss and was the social distancing queen. I hardly know or talk to anybody. I know I‚Äôd have to shell out a few hundred dollars for my ‚Äústarter kit‚Äù.  It would also complicate my income tax situation. 

Also, I live in the country where skincare is essential. People in other countries pay top dollar for shit I can buy at the drugstore. I also don‚Äôt make much money and buy all my stuff at the drugstore. My family‚Äôs excuse was ‚Äúthe line of products will be unique and specially formulated for the Japanese market‚Äù. Yeah, right. üôÑ

Part of the reason Chinese tourists buy drugstore products in masses when visiting Japan. They sell it for more money upon returning home and people are willing to pay.

Edit: Obviously I said no. But R+F is expanding to other countries and targeting people on LinkedIn and the like. Beware.",6,20,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/qgh8j9/pressured_to_join_rodan_fields/
The blatant lying of this Hun‚Ä¶ I feel bad for the struggling people she actually sucked in,"https://imgur.com/a/RdrbkLm/ 

I‚Äôve been friends with this Hun on Facebook for years. Don‚Äôt know her super personally but know her from around town, kids activities, etc..

So in this post she says a year ago they were ‚Äúdealing with getting our phones shut off, or deciding whether to pay the utilities or get groceries‚Äù as well as some sob story about her daughter having to ask the grandparents for dog food.

Let me tell you, there is no way they were at this point a year ago. 2 years ago they built a brand new humongous house in a nice neighborhood. They drive nice cars, wear nice clothes, and go on multiple nice vacations a year (Disney World, Sandals resort, cruise). Also, they frequently eat out at nice restaurants, we‚Äôve been members of the same over priced gym for a few years. Her daughter is on expensive competitive/travel sports teams and gets multiple private lessons a week. And when the team does travel, the whole family goes for the weekend too!) If they were TRULY in that position a year ago, well that was definitely from their own incredibly crazy priorities of where their money goes‚Ä¶.


It just makes me really sad (and makes her seem really really low) that she would post this. I know she‚Äôs high ranked on whatever the heck she sells, so that makes it even worse that it means she‚Äôs suckered in so many people below her üò°üò°üò°üò°",10,31,Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/qgehc1/the_blatant_lying_of_this_hun_i_feel_bad_for_the/

Blind obedience to Amway,"So my bf joined amway without me knowing (it's a long story) Anyways I haven't left him yet, but he listens to these shitty audios all the time? And they're AWFUL. They always talk about not spreading negativity, but then they turn around and the next words out of their mouth are saying to cut friends and family off if they don't ""support your buisness and have a growth mindset"". 

Speaking of mindset, that's a word that comes up often. Having a growth mindset to them, seems to mean being willing to do anything and everything for this ""opportunity"". That means cutting family and friends off, spending your own money to get PV (the way sales are measured), doing whatever your upline says with no questions asked (one of their ""3 powers"" is submitting to authority) and missing major life events for the sake of their ""own business"".

That's not a mindset. That's blind obedience, which is what amway really wants. I see a lot of people on this reddit thread saying that amway will take anyone and everyone into this business given a chance. Thats not entirely true, there is a ""vetting process"", which is where a ""candidate"" sits with a mentor and is told to read some self help book and then asked deeply personal questions about how far they're willing to go and what their motivation in life is. They are then judged to see whether or not they listen. Its not whether they are good at sales or whether theure qualified. It's a test of obedience. Will they read the stupidly long book? Will they dress in uncomfortable buisness clothes after work hours? Will they take criticism on their life choices? 

That's what amway is about. Not sales or buisness. It's just people blindly obeying unqualified idiots in hopes of being ""financially free"". In essence, it's absolutely bullshit. Never ever get involved with these people. If you get the chance, run.",45,130,Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/qfn7ev/blind_obedience_to_amway/

I outhunned a hun at Starbucks,"Someone‚Äôs post about being targeted at a Target reminded me of the time I was approached by a hun at a Starbucks. I was working on a design project, and she approached me with what I‚Äôve since learned is termed ‚Äúwarm chatter.‚Äù She starts off seeming to legitimately want to be friends, and we run into each other a couple more times at the same coffee shop. Then she moves to asking what I‚Äôm working on and if I like my job. She asks ‚Äúwhat do you work for? Schedule flexibility, financial opportunity, or travel?‚Äù I tell her all three.

Her: *gives spiel on the power of relationships*

Her: how would you like more flexibility?

Me: I‚Äôm at a Starbucks instead of an office in the middle of a workday, so I don‚Äôt think I need it?

She then starts to tell me how successful she is and how much she loves her life, so I go: ‚ÄúI love that for you. Actually, the students from this project I‚Äôm working on could use some sponsors, and they have tiers as low as $100. It‚Äôd be a great show of support from a local small business owner.‚Äù

She then goes ‚Äúum, I think I‚Äôd like to do more than give $100.‚Äù

Me: Great! Here‚Äôs my number‚ÄîI‚Äôll put you in touch with the program director, and I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll appreciate your enthusiastic support.

"Almost got roped in a while back, but now I can't remember the name of the mlm!!! Help me identify it.","Okay, so this woman I knew from college was a Title Boxing and Orange Theory instructor. When the pandemic shutdown was happening, the gyms closed. So obviously next I got a message about an ""exciting new opportunity"" she was taking advantage of. The only time I talked to her was in passing at Title Boxing. Anyways, all I had to do was sign up to watch her live stream to learn more. So I did. 

Long story short, the company wanted you to do 2 things:

1. Sign people up for ""essential technology services through THEIR representative"" and the representative will get a cut of your monthly bill.

2. Sign other people up to be reps. 

There was no physical product. The rep just gets a percentage of the bill you pay every month.

Kyani,"I have story I need to share. 

It‚Äôs long difficult overwhelming and sad. 

I do not know how to begin or where, I struggle with putting words together.

This story involves an MLM that isn‚Äôt commonly heard of. Ky√§ni. They aren‚Äôt like your typical mlm because they are not allowed to post on social media. They are supposed to only grow through friends family and recommendations. 

This story involves money, of course, loss of friendships and distancing from family members just like your typical MLM but it gets deaper and more painful because it also involves death.
The unnecessary death of a loved one that we still have not gotten over. At the end of it all our family lost lots of money, a loved one and friendships.

Ky√§ni is the only reason I am on this Reddit and on this Sub. A google search somehow lead me here about a year ago. 

I am trying to find the words and coherence to put it all together for y‚Äôall but I am really struggling here. 

Right now all I can say is Ky√§ni is the devil and please stay away from any and all MLMs. 

I will he back soon with the full story.

That time I got my friend out of a cult (MLM),"A couple years ago, I saw a post on my friend‚Äôs private page that made me stop and actually consider buying from an MLM. She claimed that taking certain Plexus helped her depression, and I was really intrigued. I asked her about it and she recommended a few products, while quoting me around $80. Steep for supplements but in the middle of TTC, and really depressed, I really wanted something that would take the edge off without going on prescription meds. Yes I know, I was dumb, but I was also desperate, which is how they convince you that you need it and it will fix you. 

Later on, probably two weeks in, I was charged around $150. . And vowed never to use her again even though I liked how I felt while taking these supplements. Until I looked up each product and realized I could buy the same thing on Amazon, for less moola and better quality. I said i‚Äôd finish up what I had bought from her and then start using what I had found. 

Two weeks later, I received an email thanking me for becoming an ambassador and to approve my next order. WHAT? I called and apparently this woman had not only signed me up to sell this mess without my permission, but had used a fake SSN to do it. I was furious. I canceled it all and messaged her, asking why she would go that route instead of making a sale. 

Guys, these companies tell their bottom line to sign people up for free, without their knowledge, and make up an SSN/use their own SSN if possible to ‚Äúcreate their own bottom line.‚Äù When I explained to her that no, that‚Äôs not okay, and no, I would not be selling this mess for her, she got quiet. She stopped posting about it on her page and later admitted she thought the practice was sketchy but she was reassured that that‚Äôs how it worked.
