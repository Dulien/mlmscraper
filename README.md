# MLM Story Scraper
Using Python and an associated library named PRAW, this application was used to scrape and store any
Reddit stories/experiences from users that had been subjected to MLM (multi-level marketing) scams. Then,
all the information associated to said posts were stored in a .csv file which could be analyzed in a spreadsheet
application such as Excel.

Originally, this program was meant to be utilized to assist a University professor with research, but inevitably
the research project was dropped.
