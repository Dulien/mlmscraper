I'm so goddamn tired of pretending,"My partner got into NFTs recently, they're a little different from ""brand name"" MLMs but they're both pyramid schemes and the methods that ""influencers"" use to recruit and keep people are identical. The language they use is very similar as well. It's MLMs but for tech bros.

I fucking hate NFTs. They absolutely devastate the environment, they steal art and then sell it with a 1000% markup, and the community is full of bigots. I am disgusted by them at a visceral level.

And now it's all my boyfriend talks about. To me, to our friends, to anyone that will listen. I'm embarrassed to talk to my own friends and family about his ""job"" (he does this full-time now) and I'm afraid of bringing him over for Thanksgiving because I don't know if he's gonna try to suck my family into it. I love my family but some of them can be a bit gullible and I cannot bear to have another person in my life dedicated to something so repulsive. He'll talk about them with me or around me and I want to be supportive because he _is_ passionate about them, but it just ends with me smiling and nodding and bottling that rage.

Before NFTs he was between jobs and on unemployment, which was absolutely fine, I did not care. But I did wish that he'd get a hobby or something because watching him play video games 24/7 while I worked and kept the room clean (we live in a house with roommates) was really bothering me. He was gardening for a little bit which I LOVED, it was so cute watching him work in the garden and so gingerly tend to the plants. But that fell off a little bit and then he got into NFTs. Immediately he started dedicating all his time to them. The gardening completely stopped. The plants all died. He was consumed.

I feel like I got monkey's pawed. I wanted him to find a passion, and he did. With something abhorrent.

I dedicate time each week to be politically active, going out a couple days a week with my org to build a better world. NFTs are the antithesis of that. They are the twisted manifestations of a market that has no rationale and ON TOP OF THAT they're burning the Amazon rainforest down! It feels like my boyfriend is working against me! I've tried to invite him out with us a couple times, just to hand out flyers or attend a march to maybe offset some of the damage NFTs are causing but he's turned me down every time. It's so depressing.

I want him to wake up and get out but he's told some mutual friends he wants to do this long term, which scares the shit out of me. I think the only way he'll wake up is if he loses all his money, and I don't want that to happen. Thank God he doesn't have access to my finances and we don't have any mutual bank accounts or anything. So I'll be okay financially. I just want to stop pretending that I'm interested in this bullshit. We've butted heads about it when he was first getting into it but kinda realized we were at an impasse, dropped it, and then never picked it up again. I want this shit OUT OF MY LIFE!!

Edit: I appreciate all the support and advice, thanks all. I still love him and we really do have plenty in common (we were friends for like 7 years before we started dating) so I want to stay and make this work. I'm basically just praying this bubble pops asap, NFTs cannot sustain themselves. Unlike MLMs, NFT projects frequently just take all the money and abandon the project, like literally a couple times a month this happens. So that's usually a pretty big indicator the industry is built on sand.

I know this paints him in an awful light, and don't get me wrong, he definitely deserves a lot of that. But keep in mind I was writing this through tears in my car so it's admittedly a bit harsh. He's generally a really great guy, just... got into something sticky.",15,35,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/qkn4ue/im_so_goddamn_tired_of_pretending/

Amway and WWDB - toxic positivity and impact on mental health,"Hi, I posted this in anti mlm sub but probably appropriate here as well. It's very long. 

 I'm a little nervous because my story is unique and may be easily decipherable, but I don't know where else to talk about this. It's strange how something impacted me in a great way, but also in a terrible way at the same time. This is going to be LONG, but it will probably be an interesting read for you.

TRIGGER WARNING: Suicide and self-harm

A little background: I have severe ADHD and PMDD (and a touch of OCD) that has been untreated for a long time and my MLM experience contributed to this. 

I will be talking about Amway and World Wide Dream Builders 

Was around the business from 18 and left when I was 21, which was half a year ago. I ended high school depressed because I was in and out of psychiatric hospitalization until I finally got to a calm point where I decided to apply to schools half a year after graduating HS and start pursuing my creative interests. 

I met somebody who talked about people who didn't go to college and were wildly successful, so that really caught my attention because I was very very bad at school and anxious because of the pressure to go. So I went through a process and earned mentorship. It was fun at first - I was excited because I felt like my life now had meaning and I had people believing I could be successful, which was one of the good things that came out of the whole experience. Although it didn't help in the long run, it did help me with my mental health in the beginning. Reading self-help books and listening to positivity gave me a mission to follow, which I desperately needed at that time. 

I decided to not go to school and started working full-time to make money for business building and becoming personally responsible. I went through a lot of personal growth getting out of my shyness and gaining self-confidence. 

Now, this has been three years of involvement, so the majority of it was a blur. 

A year into working at a 9-5 job, I became increasingly suicidal and depressed, which unfortunately wasn't abnormal. The thing about PMDD and depression for me was that sometimes I can handle the waves and then there are occasional times where I absolutely can't handle it. I was stressed because somebody I thought I loved left (I have severe attachment issues), and the pressure of 'building the business' which included reading, listening to a positive podcast, sending a message to upline, and finding people who are interested in meeting my mentors. It became unbearable, and I was afraid of talking about it to anyone because I wanted to be a stable person who can become successful. 

One day, something inside me burst and I found myself sitting in my car with a big bottle of pills, crying my eyes out. Note- I've never attempted suicide. I didn't come close to swallowing all of those pills, which will tie into the rest of the story. 

I called my manager, then I called my dad saying I wanted to kill myself right now. Then my dad picked me up from 30 minutes away. I was a mess. 

That night, I went to go out to my church small group who were a very supportive and loving group of friends and talked about what happened. I felt a little better, especially since I didn't want to be alone. I texted my upline something like this:

""I wanted to tell you that today I felt a huge urge to take my life and left work early. I'm trying to get a grip of reality right now, but I may be spotty in responding"" (since we were meant to communicate every day. 

Mind you, work was very important in the WWDB world because it was the way to build personal responsibility and have money to build your business and have a high point volume each month. I always felt really really guilty about not following through with going to work because I didn't want to be seen as lazy or incompetent. 

I can't remember what they said after my text, but over the next few days, I was off from work, sticking to my dad the whole day because, in my safety plan, I always have to be with someone for a while after a breakdown. 

Upline would text things like ""How are you? What are you doing today?"" and I'd tell them I was with dad and going along with him to grocery store"" (for me, I try to do normal daily things to distract me from how I'm feeling)

Then they ask me something like, ""Is it possible that this is a way of getting attention from your dad?"" At that time, that really didn't sound terrible, but I was always doubtful of myself. I know they said this because earlier in our friendship we talked about our dad issues and how they affect us today. I told them that I didn't think so. 

Following that, I had the choice of extending my leave of absence, which I did. Upline texted me, ""when do you go back to work?"" and I said I asked for an extension of a few more days (since it was the end of the week at that time). Then came the reply, ""is that going to help you towards your goals?"" I felt embarrassed and texted back ""no,"" and they said ""you can probably call them and reverse the extension."" I didn't, I kept my extension and pretended that I went back to work the next week. 

I ended up finding another job that was easier and closer to my home, and paid more. I took that job after talking to my upline. I still was depressed and had bad PMDD bouts where I would shut myself in the bathroom and cry for half an hour. But, I needed to make money and I needed to be personally responsible. 

I was still attending board plans and conferences and such. They actually helped me a bit because everyone was positive and encouraging. 

I spent a lot of my free time talking to people about the business and honestly, I was just as burnt out as before my suicidal incident. But I kept going because this was going to be part of my success journey. 

I had a ""mini"" breakdown and asked my upline if I could sit down and talk with them. They said once in a while is fine when it's not involving the business and wanted to make sure I wouldn't ask to sit with them frequently. 

I told them why I thought I was depressed (now I know it was also chemically and hormonally motivated) - sexual assault when I was younger, bad relationships, etc. They responded with how in their neighborhood growing up, there was a lot worse sexual abuse going on, and people do overcome it if they continue to grow. I wasn't sure if I was encouraged, but I believed that I could just get over the ""junk"" in my life. 

It's always encouraged to reach upline for help with anything - emotionally, physically, business-wise, financially. Nearly every time I had urges to self-harm or suicidal ideation, I would send a voice message upline, crying. I said things like, ""I feel like I really want to cut myself, etc. I don't know how to get through this."" The responses from them would be ""don't listen to your emotions and feelings, focus on your goals, this negativity probably means you're not getting enough positive input."" I didn't think that was unreasonable at the time.

One time I was talking with them on another occasion about suicidality and depression, they said that they knew people who actually killed themselves and what that looks like. I also got, ""I don't think you're suicidal, I think you're just not following through with your goals,"" and ""If you're suicidal, why haven't you killed yourself yet?"" - and then peppering in how everybody has suicidal thoughts pass their mind, and they're just thoughts. 

Now I believe that they're not just thoughts. They're dangerous desires I felt compulsed to fantasize about. 

This upline has had their own experience with depression and anxiety and has chalked it up to not having a life purpose or positive influence in life. They said that in building the business and mentoring people, they overcame those issues and are now free from them. They were also vocal about how psychiatric medications are a farce and don't do anything good. 

Another head-heaving aspect of all this was regarding my new partner. There's this mentality in WWDB that you are allowed to do whatever you want, but the wrong decisions will not bring you to success. So, my conscience would constantly be on overdrive and feel so guilty when I wasn't doing the right things according to the leaders. Note, they never told people what to do, but encouraged them to believe that some things will not help you grow and be serious about building. 

I met this amazing, goofy person at my work and started dating. I didn't tell upline until I felt guilty about it and ""confessed"" later. Why did I feel guilty? There's this belief within the community that you will have the best life if you have a partner that is ambitious and is on the same page with the business. This person I was dating had different goals than mine, but I brushed that aside because of how much of a compassionate person they were. 

As I thought, I was asked if what I wanted in life was someone who may not be as ambitious as I was and how it might cause heartbreak in the future. I truly truly believe that upline was saying this with a tender heart, but it caused a lot of confusion for me. 

Everytime they asked about my partner and when I'm going to have the conversation to see if he would appreciate meeting my upline, it would hurl me in an anxious spiral. Why couldn't I just let my partner be themselves and just continue with what I was doing? It wasn't like upline was saying I can't be with this person, just asking questions that made me think about it like, ""this relationship may slow you down from your big goals."" 

Now, I hadn't pursued therapy or psychiatric help during all of this time because I hung on to how I should be able to overcome my mental health issues by following through and focusing on the business. I wanted to be a good example, and follow what upline did, which included ditching a therapist after earning partnership with successful entrepreneurs. 

I wasn't explicitly discouraged from going to therapy or seeking help, but there were comments of how negativity in life means you're not following through with building the business or are not close enough to upline. 

I also forgot to mention, I was considering going to a therapy residential or inpatient program because of my terrible ups and downs with my depression. I felt so guilty about even considering it because it meant taking a break from building the business and it would show I just wasn't committed enough. 

It finally got to me when every time upline texted me, it was anxiety-inducing. It was hard to have a normal text conversation most of the time because there was always some kind of checking up on me. In WWDB, (and I understand where they come from with this because I agree to some extent that if you want to be wildly successful, you have to sacrifice a lot of comforts), you're discouraged from social media, downtime, reading non personal growth books ( I loved to read fiction but gave that up for a while because I couldn't read them without guilt), casually hanging out with friends, wasting time, drink, party, go on vacations, spending too much time with non-ambitious people, watching TV, listening to music. 

Texts would sometimes be like ""what are you up to?"" and I'd lie and be like ""oh, I'm out talking to people"" When I was really in bed scrolling on reddit or something. Or, I would text them a video of kids I was babysitting saying hi - and the second time I did it, upline would ask ""is this the only job you're doing right now?"" Just felt like I couldn't be myself but also I wasn't confident enough to speak how I really felt, which is why I feel like it went on for so long. 

I finally decided to get psychiatric medication and oh my gosh... I hadn't felt that clear in like, ever. It was amazing. It was my answer. I was able to get a better look at my situation and realized I decided to build the business because I was depressed and life had no meaning, and it felt like the only thing that gave my life purpose. But, my medication made me feel that I had a purpose and I had no reason to do things that sapped me. I decided I wanted to pursue my lifelong dream of journalism and beyond. 

I left abruptly. I get nervous whenever I get a text from them and feel a little bad because I basically ghosted. I just can't talk to them without them trying to get me to see that my situation is fixable through the business and such. I just can't.

I also knew they would discourage me from moving in with my boyfriend, because of ""influence"" and other stuff. 

I'm happy I left.

But then again I asked AI Academy for a refund. Please can somebody tell me if I will get that refund or not. How do I get my money back??? That’s a lot of money for an 18 year old like me.

When I get my money back I will block my so called “mentor”. I will leave the groups and then ghost them until that day comes.
I will tell them that I don’t have time to talk in voice chat with them.

i hate how predatory MLMs are towards students,"I've been aware of MLMs since i was a very young child, so fortunately I knew that these things are scams and I should stay the fuck away from them. But, the same couldn't be said for all of my classmates growing up.

When I graduated highschool and was going through the transition phase where most would get a part time job or get busy with uni apps, I kept seeing everyone on my Instagram repost this same exact screenshot about some business that only needed a small cost of $100 to start up and earn $10k a month afterwards. 

I talked to one of my classmates who posted that, and asked what exactly that does, and they just told me that all they needed to do was sell some shady health product while get people on board as 'sales agents'. i hated how hopeful my classmates sounded when talking about getting money for uni, when in reality they've been pumping $100 per month into this, even though they could've used that money for uni or a genuine small business of their own.

now that I'm in uni, a more camouflaged MLM model that follows a recent uptick in a food trend locally is growing bigger. these MLMs are usually dessert companies with major feel-good stories about founders who started as a small home business owner and now help a massive network of people start their own home business. you pay a fee to get into their sales agent program, pay another fee to buy the products, then get a tiny cut of profits from the miniscule sales you made in an overly saturated market of a slowly dying food trend. 

one of my favorite seniors has fallen victim to this, and it seems that she's doing a self-affirmation thing where she keeps posting those ""success comes with hard work"" videos to promote her products. It's sad that she believes this when you go on any online marketplace and see HUNDREDS of the same brand listings, just by different sales agents, and they're reputable with high sales so they get to sell their stuff at a lower price to get even MORE sales. 

i hate that MLMs are starting to ruin the lives of students like me. i hate that humans are just so easily influenced by the promise of money and they fail to see through the disguise.",6,28,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/pphi9e/i_hate_how_predatory_mlms_are_towards_students/

My Amway story: exploiting vulnerability and using diet culture to peddle products,"TW: body shaming, diet culture

I've  been lurking here (and on other anti MLM subs) for several days from my main, and only after reading  countless posts about being exploited by MLMs did I realise I was a  victim of one too. So, here's my Amway story. Identifying details  removed.

It all started when I  complained to a friend about how I’m anxious about my weight and  appearance (I have been shamed for my body for as many years as I can  remember). She suggested I join what she called an obesity management  program -  it was the best, it gave you guaranteed results. She also let  me know (fortunately) that they will have you purchase their products as a part of this program. Well, that’s not too bad, I thought, and  decided to treat it as the cost of my signing up for a diet plan with a  nutrition coach. My friend wasn’t part of the product selling bit, she  said, but she’d managed to survive. I would be okay, or so I thought.

To  commence the program, I was taken to a session that was deeply, deeply  triggering for anyone who had ever been body shamed for being fat. The  speakers insisted that it was all our fault that we are  overweight/obese, and that we could change if we chose to. They  repeatedly cycled through before/after pictures of people who had lost  hundreds of pounds through their program. Each of us were assigned  “coaches”, to whom we had to report every day. We had to record our  meals and weight in a log book and take five to six (!!) “foundational”  supplements every day, made by...Amway. We were also to exercise for at  least forty-five minutes every day. Once we managed to do this for a set  number of days, we could move on to the second part of the program. But  that’s not all, we were to report our body measurements every fortnight  along with our order history on the Amway website (how much we paid,  how many points we got, what we paid for, and so on). The second part of  the program was much more rigorous, and you couldn't eat specific types  of foods until you reached a ""target weight"" that the coaches  calculated with a BMI calculator.

I  got on the plan, but it began to look like the other people on it were  more interested in something else. Throughout, I was continuously  invited to meetings about “business previews” and “perfect  opportunities” where the speaker was someone in their thirties who had  ostensibly achieved the perfect work-life balance. They didn’t have to  work any more, they earned in six figures, they managed stress  wonderfully, and the business had helped them make a whole new social  circle and achieve the life of their dreams. It wasn’t clear how. At one  of the meetings, a speaker explained the Amway business model alongside  pictures of scenic vacation spots that he got to go to because of the  business (eyeroll). All of these people claimed to be free to manage  their time how they liked, but I don’t know, it still looks like a lot  of work to make so many phone calls and visit so many people to try and  get them to join. I was asked over and over through long (and what they  undoubtedly thought were persuasive) phone calls and in-person meetings  about whether I wanted to join the business (aha! finally admitting it's  a business), and how my whole life is ahead of me, and how this  business will benefit me more than it does most others, but I declined.

I  declined because I realized early on that this was no diet plan. I had  uncovered the base of a very large pyramid - structured, multi-tiered,  and insidiously designed to get people stuck in it for the rest of their  lives. Under the guise of helping us improve our ""health"" (never mind  that they only ever checked measurements and not other parameters), they  began to peddle toothpaste, makeup, ultraviolet light machines, and  even cookware (which, as you can see, has very little relevance to diet  and exercise). They wanted us to see how amazing their products were,  get us hooked on to them like they were once (so we could go on to  peddle them ourselves). It was not just these products - they sell  audiobooks, CDs, and other material on how to be a good leader and run a  business. At some point, they began to call me their downline even  though I had politely refused their calls to join their business.

The  genius of this entire scheme is that the diet plan works for most  people who choose to follow it. And as it works, and your body changes  to become more socially acceptable, people in your social circle  inevitably take note, and the tone-deaf among them start passing  comments on your “glow-ups” and how you have lost weight. You feel  privileged in a way you could never be before when you were fat – people  are noticing you, being nice to you, giving you things, making you feel  so much better about yourself. You start feeling grateful for this  privilege. But the Amway folks never lose an opportunity to remind you  whom to thank for this: them. They, who have been there for you every  day as you text them your weight in a panic, worrying that the numbers  on the scale won’t drop. They, who never lost an opportunity to shame  you on any given day when your weight rose by half a pound. You forget  that it was you who huffed and puffed to complete your daily exercise  quota, prepared healthy meals and restricted what you ate outside of it  with alarming severity (and felt bad when you couldn’t “control”  yourself), and spent thousands on their products. And then, once you  reach your target weight, they make you a pitch: to join the business.  But at this point, it’s an offer you can’t refuse – the people making  the offer are your coaches, your mentors, the people who got you over  the finishing line after years of failure! How could you possibly do  something to upset them, now that they’ve got you the body of your  dreams and changed the way people treat you? You’re then in hook, line,  and sinker. You are Amway, and Amway is you.

I  don’t need to go into their business model and how hard you need to  keep working to keep yourself afloat in Amway – there are some wonderful  posts on this sub that have done it already. They prey on people when  they are at their lowest and most vulnerable, shame them for their  bodies, and pin the blame on them. Those who manage to reach their  “target weight” (effectively on their own, and by spending their own  money) are indebted to their coaches. Inevitably, they can't say no when  their coaches (the very same people who “changed their lives”) make a  pitch for them to join their network marking business. What an ingenious  plan; foster gratitude in people who are at the lowest point of their  lives, and exploit this gratitude to recruit them into Amway!

Shame on you, Amway.

What  about me? Somewhere along the way, well before the final pitch, I  realized that the problem with me was not something that could be fixed  by a diet, which is a temporary fix (because restrictions are not the  way you should be made to cope with body image issues and eating  disorders). It had more to do with how I perceived myself, how I felt  about food, and how I used it as a mechanism to cope with my feelings.  And with this realization, I moved a step closer to accepting myself for  who I am. I needed to cut out these facial distractions and focus on  who I am and what I want to be. No diet and supplements could get me to  loving myself more – and somehow, I had realized it myself. So, I left  the program.

I had great  difficulty leaving amid the gaslighting and shouting and the attacks on  my self-worth (such as how if I am leaving, I am not one of the winners,  I am a quitter). These people didn’t even know me. But no, all that  matters to them is how much I buy from them. Goodbye, folks, hope to  never see you again (I did like some of their products, though.  Seriously).

I was Conned into Two Pyramid Schemes During the Pandemic,"So, I literally made this reddit account 2 weeks ago to talk about all this. I kind of want to share my sad story and vent a little. It's a pretty long, and it might be a bit confusing, and I'm sorry for that! So... TLDR: I was roped into 2 MLMs and feel dumb but determined to never get scammed again.

Ok, so 2020 was a life-changer for everyone. Me, personally, I was a newlywed and my wife and I were expecting our first child in August. College was going great (BTW I graduated last month), and my longterm plan was to become an airline pilot. But then the lockdown started, and we moved in with my in-laws so my wife could feel closer to hoe during all the chaos/pregnancy. With all of the forced downtime between my zoom classes, I played a lot of videogames with my father-in-law and brother-in-law---and I was making over 400 million dollars in this fun game called Elite Dangerous (saving up for something big). And I had a thought pop into my head:

""you know, I'm pretty lazy. I bet if I applied myself in real life like I did in this game, I'd be a millionaire, or at least I'd be able to provide for my family without having to BE at a job. I could retire early maybe... I would be...what's a good word for this? Independent? But with money... I would be **financially independant!**""

Too bad I didn't know that ""financial independence"" was a buzzword for MLMs.

I started talking with my wife about starting a small business and learning the ropes. I'm good with computers, so maybe I'd develop an app or a website, and I drafted a couple ideas. But I didn't have a clue where to start! And as I was talking to my mother-in-law about it, she told me that our neighbors were actually working towards financial independence too! Now, she had no idea that they were with Amway, but we were both thinking ""this is too good to be true! What are the odds?""

So I talked to them. They're really nice. And they told me about this ""mentor"" that they had been working with for some time, how he was helping them to work towards financial independence, how they were excited to quit their jobs in a few years, how I could too, the whole shebang. I was initially very impressed, and I kept asking ""when can I talk to this leader guy? What is your (the couple's ) business? I want to do this \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, do you think your mentor could help me too?"" I was so naive! I thought he would help me learn to start and run my OWN business!!! I had LITERALLY no idea that they were just part of a company. I thought they had an independent ecommerce store.

Well, fast-forward a couple weeks, and I finally get allowed into the meeting with this big-name guy. Man, he sucked. He was a huge jerk! And he kept flaunting his wealth, saying that he was right that money was the most important thing in the world and that no one could deny it. I was repulsed by it, and I never wanted to talk to him again. And then I heard the word ""Amway."" And I was like ""I think I've heard of that before..."" A quick google search, and it's a pyramid scheme. Oh my. Oh boy. Where am I? My wife and I left feeling icky.

But... I can't remember why I did it, but I decided to go to one more meeting. And that hooked me. I was sold ""the dream."" I was excited to run with the pack and become untethered from the corporate world. My angel wife supported me despite having serious misgivings, but man was it the worst decision I could have made. They had me create a second bank account, sign up for a $30/month subscription service that was essentially Facebook voice-messages, get the $90 sample pack so I could know what I'd be peddling, register myself and my wife as ""IBOs"" (Independent Business Owners, which was the most ironic part of it, since we weren't independent OR business owners. I chaffed at that a lot and my upline hated when I brought it up). I was hunnified.

Fortunately, Amway only sold me ""the dream;"" their actual products were their undoing. I just sat there, looking at all of the products in their little sample box, realizing that out of all the products Amway sold, I only ACTUALLY liked and would reccomend one of them (the hand lotion. My goodness, that was moisturizing). But the rest of the stock? I either did NOT like at all, or I thought it was fine EXCEPT YOU COULD GET THE SAME EXACT THING AT WALMART FOR SIX DOLLARS INSTEAD OF FORTY! And I had a breakdown. I told my wife ""I'm a capitalist, and I don't believe in buying or selling something that's just not worth the price or the effort! How could I in good conscience sell ANY of this to anyone I know? Or anyone I don't know, for that matter?"" I couldn't just create a market demand for something ordinary that already had better competitors, it didn't make sense to me. It wasn't like competing against Coke with Pepsi, it was like competing against Coke with Shasta Cola or the out-of-syrup freestyle machine! So I left. I didn't really ghost them, because it's not my style, but I was never going to let them sway me to stay. They were understandably confused.

Now that I was out of that MLM, I was back onto my plan of starting a real business. My wife and I had everything planned out for the next 10 years. Graduation, Pilot School, Business Launch, when to buy a starter home, we even had plans for what to do if more kids came at certain times. You know--being smart about the future. All I needed was to learn how to start a business. So I talked to my financial advisors... a longtime friend of mine and his boss, from WealthWave (a parasite company of WFG). The thing is, I had been working with them for a while now, and I still have mutual funds with them. I'm conflicted on that, but I'll get back to the story.

I told them about my stint with Amway and how I wanted to do something that was my own. And the boss guy said to me ""well... why start your own business? You could join us and do what we do."" It was another MLM pitch that I wasn't even prepared for--All the tools and infrastructure is already set up, you just have to get in and start working, you can make more than your upline, unlimited earning, etc.

""No way!"" I thought. ""I won't do MLMs ever again!"" And then boss guy hit me with ""This isn't an MLM. It's illegal for a financial company to be an MLM."" And I was just like ""ok I'm sold <(\^\_\^)>""

AGH! I was so stupid!!! I had no idea! But it gets WORSE. This time, I stayed for EIGHT. MONTHS. I only got out two weeks ago (May 12th). During that time I spent 100s, maybe 1,000s of dollars obtaining insurance licenses in various states, signing up for Insurance Agent insurance, getting a stupid company email address (which I finally got deleted today) and company website with my name and contact info on it. And the worst part is that we were actually doing something that I thought was worthwhile! I'm still conflicted on it--they teach basic financial concepts to people and help them choose plans and things. But wait a minute! My boss was a college dropout! And that in itself is not a bad thing at all--but he learned all of his financial skills from GOOGLE. What credentials does HE have to teach finance?????

OH! And that's another thing: BOTH times, in BOTH MLMs, I expressed a desire to drop out of college and dedicate my whole self to ""the business."" THANK GOD that I didn't go through with it. But man, WealthWave guys all encouraged it, completely slamming higher education--and I was more ok with that than what Amway did. I mean, you do you, right? If you don't like college, you can say it. Give me advice that you think I need and I'lll appreciate it. WealthWave did that, even though it was flawed. But my Amway upline? When I told them ""I'm going to drop out of college and become a full time IBO!"" They were **I N D I F F E R E N T**. They expressed no joy, apprehension, encouragement, or worry. And that hit me hard. I was like ""man, you guys are my mentors... It's a big life choice. Shouldn't this be a big deal? Don't you care one way or another?"" I guess you all know the answer.

Anyways, back to the story. The whole time with WealthWave, I was excited but dissapointed. Not because I never got paid (which I didn't), but because I felt like I was closing the door to what I really wanted to do--what I dreamed to do--fly for the airlines. And both Amway and WealthWave said ""do this first and fly when you're rich,"" but man... no! It's not always about the oodles of money. Sometimes you gotta follow your heart. And the whole time I worked for WealthWave, I had the nagging feeling that I DIDN'T own my own business. It was an employment position--no--an independent contract! And apparently you can switch around your lines, so if for some reason I became unpopular or something, I could literally have lost all my downline to someone else. There's no job security! AND, I was pretty sure that the whole ""everyone needs an IUL to save for retirement"" thing was not true, because look at me--I NEVER got an IUL. I don't really want an IUL for retirement. I think they are too expensive and yield too little returns to be used as a retirement saver. PLUS, on all of the IUL company partner websites, you have to acknowledge that you AREN'T using IULs as retirement options! Thankfully, I never sold one.

Anyways, everything started to break down again when my cousin-in-law and their mother joined the team. They are animals when it comes to business, in a good way. Oh my gosh, it's incredible how dedicated they are. I told them that their skills were so great, they could start their OWN business and actually succeed. But instead they have dedicated themselves to revamping the company. And they started explaining to me how WealthWave worked like an MLM. ""Wait a minute... it's not an MLM. Finance companies can't be MLMs!"" I said. ""It's an MLM"" they replied. I googled it. It was part of WFG, which was--as it turned out--an MLM. Once I knew that, I googled if WFG and WealthWave were schemes, good/bad, etc. I knew what would happen if I googled it--which is why I never did it. You know, you never read the anti ""propaganda"" when you want to stay convinced that it works. But actually, this wasn't the final nail in the coffin. The REAL defining moment was after that, when I wrote down my feelings and talked to my wife. I wrote exactly this:

>Both times that I have wanted to start a business, I sought help from people that ended up recruiting me into a Multi-Level-Marketing company (MLM). Neither of the companies actually helped me reach my original goal: owning my own business. Both of them claimed I would own my own business through working at their company.

That was a huge moment for me. These companies warped my dreams to fit their agenda.

And then I wrote this next part. It was a little less impactful, but it helped me process what I was actually feeling:

>Is this my lot? Am I a sucker, perilously susceptible to others’ tantalizing claims of fortune? Blinded by greed and naivety to the truth?Am I too afraid to start my own business: YES.Would it be easier to work for other businesses (i.e. get a job or work at WealthWave): YES.

The MLMs didn't deserve all the blame. I was too fearful to do what I had actually set out to do. Whether or not I would have been successful, I let my fear back me into an imaginary corner, where the only way out of being stuck at a 9-5 job for 40+ years appeared to be through these companies. But honestly? Being stuck at a 9-5 job pays better. That's not to say that I'm giving up on my dream--far from it! Once I get an established career as a pilot, I plan to open up a board-game cafe. Just a nice, fun place for people to hang out that combines my two favorite things (and maybe a gamestore next door so I can host D&D parties), in a college town somewhere, or an artsy city. But I digress.

So where am I now? Well, I've gotten out of WealthWave and WFG. Before terminating my account, I changed all the personal info. I deleted my account, changed my debit card, I'm planning on closing and reopening all of my bank accounts so that I don't get randomly charged by Amway or WFG months or years down the road. I've got a new phone number (a side effect of going all-in with WealthWave in the end: I got a second phone. My old phone became my ""work"" phone), and I deleted all of the personal information of my friends and family that I had stored on my computer. I cancelled all my insurance licenses so I can't even get paid for a contract I could have worked on (this will save me from being tied into maintaining it--legally I won't be able to touch it).

But man. If I could do it all over again? I think I would. I needed the experience. I'm never going to let myself get scammed again. And the crazy/sad thing is: only one person half-heartedly tried to poin out my bad choices. Another in-law. But the rest--all my family and friends--they AVOIDED me, my calls, texts, and facebook messages. I didn't realize it until I sent messages apologizzing to each one (and there were a good 200). They ALL responded within a day, and most responded instantly or within a few minutes. They were always there. They weren't busy, or hard to reach. They were avoiding me because I was being used to prey on them. I was praying on them! And that honestly hurts. But I'm happy knowing 4 things:

1. I graduated college. Suck it, former uplines!
2. My friends and family all love me and forgive me.
3. I am back on my life track.

my mother was told she'd never have children, i say. without the vitamins, i wouldn't be sitting next to you right now. but she took the vitamins and within three months she was off of all the drugs. she has lupus, you know. that's an autoimmune disorder. ~~whatever that means.~~ she takes bloodthinners now, but it's been ten years and now ten-year-old-me is sitting next to you. the man who created them is a visionary. that means he's like a genius.  and ~~he's going to save the world~~.

you tell me it's the business part you're unsure about.

my dad's been doing this for ten years. when i turn eighteen, i'm going to sign up too. the products created me, right? it's the least i can do to pay back. but for now, i'm getting ready. i go to dinner parties with all the other associates, and listen to the training. i listen to the dvds in the car with dad. i come with dad to all the presentations, even when he doesn't need to take me. i take my vitamins every day. when i'm older, my dad and i will go to events together every thursday, where we'll learn to be better associates. my dad and i spend a lot of time together. he isn't a ~~wage slave~~ typical office worker that goes to work in the morning and comes back at night. ~~he can spend time with me.~~ he has true wealth. we live a healthy life. i don't drink poison, like soft drinks. i don't eat toxic food like mcdonalds. all the other kids do, and it's their loss. **i know better**. i'm smarter than all the other kids because i take omega-3. do you know about omega-3? i try to tell the other kids about omega-3 but they're all too stupid. even their parents are fat and stupid and go to mcdonalds and don't understand when i tell them about omega-3. their parents make them get poison vaccines.

"Never heard of MLMs so I fell for one, and during the pandemic... my story will interest you in what they have come down to doing"," Hello everyone how are you? I hope you are doing well, especially at a time like this. I do apologize in advance for this being long and for any mistakes, but I hope you will enjoy reading this story of ridiculousness hahaha--- Here we go.

So I graduated college May 2020 with a business degree (key point) majoring in business admin and minored in marketing. A friend of mine, we will name her Betty, started sampling me stuff from a company known as Amway. I honestly liked some of the products they have like their hairspray because it actually holds my hair (or is this bad?? hahaha). Then, yes you guessed it, I became a customer of hers and also wanted to support her because she has been through a lot and I am a supportive person so why not. Then, she asks me if I wanted to join because I would be a business owner and learn about sales and since you like to do marketing stuff, you will like it. Since I saw her doing a great job at this, I said okay sure and was excited to work with her because we would have been business partners and it sounded exciting.

She tells me about her upline and that she would like to meet with me, via Zoom (covid haha so no weird coffee dates as the other stories I have read). I go okay. So her upline tells me about the company and everything and it still sounded exciting. Betty also did a presentation for me via zoom meeting. After a few meetings, I went for it. I had to listen to audios, which I kind of liked lmao because they. Were. So. Inspirational.... yeah leave me alone. Laugh all you want and call me names hahaha

But fast forward and I was in. I was sampling things to my coworkers and letting them know hey I am part of business, I have like my own little store and they go oh wow cool. Then, I found myself wanting to get the monthly bonus for getting as many customer sales and thinking I am cool. I ended up spending around $300 on products to not even get the bonus, just got $50 back. Then, I had to send out messages to see who wanted to join my team. I found myself sending out messages to people from high school that I was friends with but haven't spoke to them in a while. I wanted to be able reconnect with them and work with them in a way. I was even reaching out to family members because I missed them and wanted to have this thing going on. Again, call me the typical names for such MLMs because yeah lol. Anyway, I was given basically a script of how to send out the messages. I had a few people who were interested and hosted zoom meetings, but later on declined, which I am happy they did.

For the weekly meetings, I had to pay $5 a week because the top upline couple/people were paying a fee for having over 100 people join in on the zoom. I did this for 4 weeks. Then, the big Spring Conference was coming around where you get advice and listen to the millionaires of the business to see how you can succeed in your business. 1) it is virtual 2) it was about $120. Betty asked me to please pay for my ticket ASAP so I will not lose my spot and here was when I was like this is ridiculous. I just wanted to do this business my own way, by myself, because I thought it was actually mine. I told Betty that I cannot afford this ticket, which I could've but I am not paying $120 for a meeting that is virtual. I am not even paying for virtual concerts for my top favorite artists, I am going to give money to strangers, like no thank you. To Betty, I am known to love music and movies. I also have a dream to work in this industry later on. I wanted to after I graduated, but covid ruined everything. Since I couldn't go to the movies because of covid, I ended up getting all of the movie subscriptions available haha. Disney, Netflix, HBO, Apple Music, I am even paying for an app to learn a new language, basically keeping myself entertained while being stuck at home when I am not at work. She kept asking me about paying for my ticket and it will be a great opportunity for me and she doesn't want me to miss out on it to help me with the business. I told her I could not afford it because I had other bills to pay. She then tells me, to cancel my subscriptions so ""I can save money"" for the ticket and can focus on the business.... I started thinking uhhhh I am sorry but it is one of my passions to watch movies and listen to music since I would like to work in that industry one day. Then, I went to the doctor and had to get tests done and my insurance does not cover all of it, so that was another bill I needed to focus on. And get this, I had to send out 20-30 messages a week to people who would like to join the team. I did not know who to send this many messages to, nor was I going to look for strangers on the internet who are aware of these MLMs telling me to get lost. I already felt bad for not telling them it was Amway because they tell you you are not supposed to give out the name due to the bad reputation. Ohhh another thing with the conference ticket, I missed a little detail. I kind of wanted to go attend to this thing, but was still not going to pay for it. I asked Better if I could just go without paying because since it was a big opportunity, I did not want to miss it. Betty told me to speak with her upline that I met during the zoom meetings to see what I could do. I get on the phone with her upline and tell her about the doctor bills and such... She asks me, ""are you eligible for the stimulus check? Because if you are, you can use that money for your doctor bill and be able to go to the conference. Or you can use a credit card. My husband and I have been through our finances before and were in the same position you are in and had to sacrifice some money and use a credit card"".... A stranger basically telling me how to use my stimulus check and credit cards, basically my money hahaha I told her that I will have to look over what I have and get back to her. Then, I just sent out a whole email to Betty saying sorry I cannot continue with this anymore. Maybe later on I will be able to, but at this moment I can't. I am not in the right headspace to do this kind of stuff. Mind you that she has deleted her social medias, sometimes gets into arguments with her boyfriend when he wants to do something but she can't because she is focused on this business, etc etc. And the stories I have read, basically is the same thing.

I do wish her well and hope she can at least succeed because her upline even told me she was doing such a great job at doing what she is doing. But I read a story that he was very successful, but as time went by, he slowly started losing everything and just had to quit. So I hope my friend does not learn the hard way or go down like this. I want to tell her the stories I have read, but she says they are not a pyramid scheme and that they are way different and basically is already more than knee deep into this thing. Which I mean, great you have something to work on and such, but yeah I cannot be like this. And when I was leaving, she said that she did not want me to worry about money ever again and we could travel later on with the money we worked hard for etc etc. Like I am sorry, but I think I will be okay with my dream career goal of working in the entertainment industry :D

If you read all of this, I appreciate you taking the time to read it. If you reply to this post, I will respond, feel free to ask any questions. I wish you all well and hope you are doing well during this hard time. It will soon be over and we can go back to normal once everything calms down :) Have a great day!",24,79,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/myiqet/never_heard_of_mlms_so_i_fell_for_one_and_during/
Was told you would enjoy this here. The ask reddit asked me “Have I ever missed an opportunity to be rich?” this is my MLM story.,"I’m 50/50 on it. There’s someone I met a few years back that asked me if I wanted to attend a possible opportunity for me. I said yes and basically had an interview with a very seemingly rich person. They drove a high end sports car, wore decent clothes and instead of selling the opportunity to people they gave people every reason to leave. They planned meetings on Super Bowl days to see who was really serious because a large portion of Americans are big on Super Bowl. If you missed a meeting you were out of the “club” basically. That’s all the things that made it feel like it was worth it. A way to assess your commitment. 

These are the red flags I had noticed. They constantly talked like a never ending infomercial the things you see on commercials that vow it will change your life and all you have to do is watch a webinar or read a book they are selling and they talk about 40 minutes on how it can change your life and never reveal what that thing is. I fucking hate those ads. Eventually my “mentor” did reveal what that was however that just sparked more red flags. It was a form of pyramid scheme where you basically buy shit in bulk for a company and then break down the bulk and sell it like any organization would. Then it goes a little strange where you get a percentage cut of the profits and you could basically buy and sell back to yourself... I asked other members who were in the group that didn’t seem to be as financially well off as they should be how long they have been doing it. One said 3 years... then they wanted you to join this “make your wishes come true” theme event if you donated like $25. Then I met the head guy who started it all who was a 3 diamond millionaire or some shit. (Apparently millionaires have rankings, I didn’t know that either) the way he said shit was not motivational to me. He said he will “take down anyone who messes with his family” and talked a lot about how being rich will ensure your wife won’t leave you. I admittedly recently was divorced during this time so hearing shit like that pissed me off. At the time I liked to believe good people still exist and aren’t just looking for a money grab, is that true love? My overall thesis was this. 

It seemed like a scam that rich people did to try and get poor people to donate time and money to a dream for their own profits. It felt predatory rather then helpful. I generally can judge good character pretty decently and the guy who was on the very top gave me very bad evil vibes. I have no idea if I made a mistake or not.",5,38,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/mwvnkr/was_told_you_would_enjoy_this_here_the_ask_reddit/

My experience with Amway,"So I've been approached by Amway twice.  I figure I put my experience here for others, hopefully it helps (I've never sold any Amway products, was almost initiated but couldn't pull the trigger).  

I'm gonna change some names for obvious reasons:

Matt will be the Amway rep that approached me at my management position.

Dave will be the high ranking Diamond.

Giselle will be my coworkers mentor.

My first time I was approached I was as a sales manager at my old job and recently through a coworker at my new job.  The first time was actually delivered quite well, made me feel unique and special since he didn't approach any of my staff.  Hidden under the guise of mentorship and helping people (which I'm all about).  Now up to this point my job was pretty good.  I was well read, had many skills in marketing, investments, content creation etc...but who doesn't like an extra side hustle that could help people as well?  So I decided to meet with this guy (Matt) and got interviewed for a sit down with his ""mentor"".  Now I'm a time sensitive kind of guy, I have a lot on my plate and time is money.  I met with him first, gave him my story (my life experiences, my skills, why I'm interested blah blah) however he still wouldn't tell me what this opportunity was.  Standard Amway, needs to make sure they can trust your mindset to be open minded because it's easy to judge a book by the cover without hearing the context or both sides of the argument.  I made it clear that trust goes both ways, I'm more than open minded and since I met him more than halfway and that if he didn't tell me by next meeting I'd have to pass.  He agreed, gave me some homework in summarizing the Business of the 21st Century by Robert Kiyosaki and said he would disclose all my next meeting.  Funny thing, my boss is actually good friends with Kiyosaki and I'm familiar with his work so I figure this could be a good opportunity (like minded people think alike).  So we meet again, same spot same time.  I arrive early as always, noticed home boy (Matt) is meeting with another person before me (thought it was strange since he made it seem like this is a very special opportunity and he doesn't approach just anyone).  Cut to the chase, we get down to business when he's done with the other guy (who happens to have another copy of the book I was asked to summarize).  He lays out the plan, the business name, the general gist of operations and asks me if I'd like to meet his mentor.  I agree and we meet with this ""mentor"".  His mentor Dave seemed like a cool guy, happens to be an extremely high diamond member, highest in my area ever apparently.  We talk, he goes in detail about the plan and how this mentorship is helpful for everyone, which is the big reason I'm there.  Some of the key takeaways were about coaching people through past experiences since you'd build new relationships that weren't available to you in your current network state and to make money while doing it through selling goods and subscriptions that would otherwise be spent at other businesses and simply putting it into your business.  I'd have to attend mandatory meetings, interviews, communicate with upline and downline and recruit people by being duplicable (which was a little less that what I was currently doing at my job at the time).  I felt good about the whole thing, we talk story, talk about the future meetups and Dave tells me to talk to Matt about what to do next.  I schedule and start game planning my approach to really break in to this business and what I would like to see before moving forward.  I decided I wanted to see the tier percentage breakdown of where everyone is allocated (diamonds all the way down to fresh recruits), who decides what material is approved (books, videos, teachings), I wanted annual tax statements, and I wanted to know if promotions for tiers were based on output, peer reviewed or mixture of the two (I wanted to know about promotion because I'm aiming for the top and I don't like to be held down by preconceived judgement.  I'm not exactly the religious, white picket fence, family man that all the Amway people I meet seem to be and don't want to be judged if I don't conform).  Anyways I show up to my last meeting with Matt to discuss my plan, go over rules and possibly finish recruitment.  

&#x200B;

Now, here's where I got ousted by Matt.  I was told about communikate and some of the subscription based items that were, ""not required"" but heavily recommended, for new recruits.  I thought the startup was too heavy for certain people and if Amway was such a blessing, why shouldn't I assume most of the labor and heavy lifting for my team?  I wanted to outsource some of the subscription with free to use options, (use messenger or whatsapp for communication, sell on social media within the rules since I'm versed in copyright laws and the do's and don'ts of social media marketing) just to make the startup easier for my team.  I was gonna go to the meetings, read the books, generate the plans with my mentors and relay the message to my team so they wouldn't need to sacrifice time and money in such a crucial conversion time to startup since most people have day jobs, kids, other obligations. I'd say it be more attractive with a lower overhead cost, especially if it's all about mentoring people.  I had this plan to make it easy and attractive (since the overall reputation of Amway is negative why not put a positive spin to it), to put time and opportunity in my teams pocket by doing most of the work (since it's duplicable right?) and taking away most of the startup risk.  I was met with a host of negative comments, saying we can't coach something we've never done, why reinvent the wheel if it's not broken, the whole idea is to be easy and duplicable why go against this vetted process?  I told them I wouldn't be reinventing the wheel necessarily, simply modernizing it that's all.  Going from a stone wheel to a rubber one to keep the analogy short.  Best of all Matt kept going on about being duplicable and that he wouldn't be able to help coach me or advise me if I get into trouble, since he doesn't have any experience with the skills that I had listed.  He said I would be essentially traveling down a road no one really travels since the plan they have works and mine is unproven at best.  I was told that higher tier promotions were in fact board approved by Amway and other higher members which was a no no for me.  I wasn't provided a annual tax statement to prove income was genuine or to see what kind of cost was needed at higher tiers.  I restated my views on this but still expressed interest because I felt I could be a great benefit in this business and could really help people if they just let me try my plan.  Matt then cut the interview short, simply said the offer isn't available anymore and told me they didn't need people ""like me"".  Overall, hated the dude after that (for a time, I let it go) but he's entitled to his opinion.  I was more upset that they couldn't see my view to really create an equal opportunity for people who I tried to recruit instead of an uphill battle.

&#x200B;

After that I left it alone, closed the book for now...until my coworker approached me.  Not so versed in his pickup script, was kind of clunky...We were doing a hard job and we grumbled, moaned, bitched etc.  Wished for better jobs and wished that no one ever needed to work or be in this rat race.  He then asked if I would be interested in this new opportunity, in which I replied, ""Let me guess?  You're gonna ask me to read this book by Robert Kiyosaki right?""  He looked shocked lol, laughed and asked how I knew.  Anyways I go through the process again, his upline is more open minded, more modern and are actually open to my ideas.  I told them about my past experience and they were sympathetic and told me it's all about who you're under since it's all based on coaching and mentoring from each networks past experiences.

&#x200B;

 Long story short though I wasn't able to get the tax statements and the approval to outsource some of the material.  I didn't pull the trigger because after doing some digging I found out that you get a cut of the subscription based products as you progress the ranks and that the material (videos, seminars, motivational recordings) you make as a higher tiered participant earned you new bonuses or income.  Makes sense though,  didn't have a way to confirm as I asked Giselle about this and she didn't have any knowledge about this practice (she just made platinum).  I asked my coworker if he knew anything about it and he didn't since he just started.  All good though, I thanked them for their time and wished them both the best.  Also when I went through the process again I saw Matt, apparently he made double ruby, was some hotshot now and was being groomed to move up the tiers by Dave.  He said hi to me and I returned the favor.  Hindsight is 20/20, I really do wish them all the best...even Matt.  I just hope they don't lose sight of who they are as the material that's being passed around is extremely manipulative (I recommended a few books and was turned down, too radical I guess).

&#x200B;

TLDR

I was approached by Amway, wanted to modernize the business plan to help people and got cut from the recruitment process (rather rudely).  Got approached again, had some good talks and laughs.  Agreed to disagree, wished them the best.",13,44,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/lnmw52/my_experience_with_amway/
Why I left Amway/LTD," This will be posted in r/antiMLM too.

Lately I have been seeing more Amway posts than normal on reddit, it seems they've been more active than usual. Now seems like a good time to post my story since quitting 8 months ago.

My participation in Amway and its tool scam counterpart LTD (Leadership Team Development) lasted from Jan. 2019- Mar. 2020. I didn't fully quit until later in the summer, but I will describe more about that.

I'm going to change the names of the people in this story to remain anonymous.

Upline= Brad

Fiance= Rebecca

I am a guy in my late 20s who lives in the US, I served in the military and now work full time at a large retail chain. I never thought of myself as the type to get scammed, which is why I ignored the warnings of Rebecca and my mom.

Brad (complete stranger) came into my store to do a little bit of shopping. I helped him find what he was looking for, and we chatted for a few minutes. A little bit later in our conversation he asks if I was open to extra income, and that he himself is a veteran who does marketing with other military members and veterans. It seemed reasonable so we exchanged contact information. I can't say I was necessarily actively looking for another income source, but I thought it wouldn't hurt. Brad is excellent at presenting Amway in a positive and non-threatening way, so nothing really seemed out of the ordinary. MLMs and pyramid schemes were a foreign concept to me before meeting him.

My former direct upline, Brad is a Platinum in Amway. I'm not going to bother describing what that means, simply he has a fairly large group (\~100) of cult followers, I mean ""business owners"" underneath him; enough that he hosts his own weekly meetings.

Amway's products are of average quality with steep prices. Rebecca and I spent way too much money every month on stuff we didn't even need.  On average, I alone spent about $300 just with amway products, plus $120 for LTD subscriptions totaling about $450 to $500 a month.

As part of Brad's group we were regularly drilled on having to spend most of our money on that crap. Brad would often say we shouldn't be consuming any food that is not from our business until 5pm, otherwise we would be ""cheating"" on our business.

One time at a meeting he literally said he didn't care if Amway sold hula hoops, since to him it's not about selling products, rather the ""opportunity"" The items that amway sells is just a way to perpetuate its scam. There is no real accountability whether its distributors actually sell items or fake customer receipts. Recruitment is a focus more than anything else, it was about buying stuff from your own business and finding others to do the same.

Info Sessions (Weekly Meetings): During my amway stint I was working 10 to 11 hour days at my job often getting up at 4am to be at work. The drive to these meetings is one hour one way. The info session wouldn't start until 8pm (more like 8:30pm) and normally ended at midnight. I was then exhausted by the time I had to get back up for work.

Streaming in live via zoom was not allowed if you lived within a couple hours.

Brad intentionally rented out a smaller room than what we had people for to give the impression to guests that this is a ""hot"" place to be. People standing in the back was always a thing. If you were a guy, and you got there early to grab a seat, you would still end up having to give it up to a female (even if she was late) if no other seats were open. 1950s gender roles like this are common throughout all of LTD.

He would spend the first 30 to 40 minutes explaining how terrible jobs are and how great Amway is and how it's not a scam, and that it's actually an inverted triangle (I still don't understand that). He would always say that he doesn't get paid unless his downline succeeds too. He never mentioned the thousands of dollars per month LTD pays his family for his  contributions. Too many times would he make crazy income claims like a 2-5 year plan working part time to ""quit your job"", yet if we didn't succeed it was because we're not doing enough.

The final hour of these info sessions was for IBOs only, we would spend all night doing recognition for things like contacting and recruiting new people, or spending all our cash on amway. It really was just a big waste of an evening. I started thinking that this might actually be a cult, it was just too weird.

Contacting people for amway was by far one of the worst things about all this. I made a fool of myself calling old friends from years back. Most facebook messages I sent were ignored, and Rebecca was unwilling to use her list of contacts to help build my business; looking back I don't blame her.

I even resorted to using the app Bumble to get prospects. Within a month or so I recruited Pete (a  coworker), but he became such an Amway Kool aid drinker that by the time I quit he was insufferable to be around. Thankfully we don't work at the same place anymore. I would go out each day after work to grocery stores and places like Walmart or Target to bring up business to strangers that look like ""sharp and ambitious individuals that I would want to be friends with"".

I have no clue what that's supposed to mean, how could I tell just by looks?

I even dreaded getting off work because I would have to go do that for hours. We were trained to avoid mentioning Amway at all costs; instead we should say we work with Best Buy and Apple. Many strangers would tell me it's a scam or they tried amway before. To get potential prospects to his meetings, Brad often told me to lie to them that we don't know when the next info session will be. Essentially, we should use the fear of missing out tactic to motivate people. I really just felt like a whore for Amway. There was such an internal struggle within me about all this that created so much anxiety. Looking back now all this contacting was just absurd, it's not normal. People with any sense in their head don't walk around for hours at grocery stores talking to strangers about some ""business opportunity"".

It seems like the conferences and subscriptions to LTD is how Amway Diamonds made a lot of their money. This is where a lot of the weird cult stuff would take place. The diamonds would spend hours late into the night yammering on about their rags to riches story and how anyone that wants it can be filthy rich. It seems like everyone there just worshiped the ground these rich people walked on. On Sunday morning the blatantly Christian church service would happen; the leader of the conference would go on and on all morning about how God wants us to have an amway business so we can be part of the ""bigger picture"". The lines between business and religion were so blurry that at times I had to ask myself if I was at church or a business seminar. As an atheist myself it was incredibly difficult to accept all this as anything other than religious indoctrination to excuse leeching off people's money, but I stuck around for a little longer because maybe there was something in all that garbage that would help me grow my income.

The last meeting I ever attended was in late February (right before the pandemic) at this meeting one of Brad's ""downline leaders"" pretty much said to all of us in the room that we weren't working hard enough to allow Brad's wife to retire from her work at home job.

That night was the catalyst for me to really start taking an objective look at my current life situation. It seemed best that I distance myself from the negative that I had allowed to thrive in my life. For the most part I went off the radar with almost no contact with anyone in Amway

I hadn't quit yet, not until Brad wanted me to attend a large conference of Summer 2020 during the pandemic in Texas. I was not about to risk my health or Rebecca's so that some fat Diamond could get a little bit richer. Brad and his IBOs were behaving irresponsibly during the pandemic, not what I think real professionals would do.

Their poor behavior included large social gatherings potentially spreading the plague, and their general bad attitude to recognizing that the health of the general public is more important than their attempts to become millionaires. I knew it was my responsibility to do the right thing and be part of the solution and not the problem.

I blocked Brad's number and all other amway numbers in my phone. I ceased contact completely; I contacted LTD to cancel my subscriptions. My decision was made that we were quitting, but it wasn't easy mentally. Since then I have seen a few of Brad's downline at my work (shopping? no probably contacting), they don't bother to wear masks even though it's a state mandate where I live. The few times they have been at my store we would chat briefly, but I always had this weird feeling they were trying to get me to say what I have been up to.

I could never recommend anyone to get involved in Amway or any other MLM, I suppose it was an expensive learning experience, but Rebecca and I have moved on from this chapter and our lives are better now than before.

Amway Or No Way Baby,"So the other day I was approached by someone who ""works"" for Amway. They told me about this great opportunity and told me how large their team was, and then they offered to have me hear more about the opportunity. I decided to say yes as I'm very skeptical about any offerings. The meeting was located in a nice venue in the city, and all the people were super nice; however, certain things started to raise red flags. The biggest thing was I asked my now ""mentor"" about the products and how she sells so many to make a living, and she would always brush the question off saying it's not always about selling or just not being able to answer a question at all. I sat through the presentation anyway, and they almost had me convinced. I went home after a fun evening and decided to immediately look them up on [Scam Risk](https://www.scamrisk.com/) to see if anyone had said anything. Turns out there have been hundreds of reviews of people who got scammed or lost money through Amway. My so-called ""mentor"" messaged me back and this is how it went.

Recruiting Tactics / Earnings Pitch,"u/kdd20 asked about the recruitment and tactics this is my lengthy response 

LONG RESPONSE (I apologize in advance)

Here’s what they’d tell me and this is what I’d do, even from when I first started they told me “We don’t recruit, we show others an opportunity and it’s their choice if they want to join along” meaning the person being presented everything has to want to join WWDB. 

Because although Worldwide Dream Builders is the training portion and amway is the products we don’t rely on telling others we are part of Amway. Which sounds deceiving and honestly now I see it as it is but it was in hopes someone would listen to our personal story before excluding themselves from the conversation because they heard the word “Amway” .. they call “recruiting” or walking up to strangers and chatting someone up as “Business Building”  or “dropping the message” you’re out there you’re sharing YOUR OWN personal story although they’ll sound relatively alike to someone else also building it. 

So yes they encourage going to places like Starbucks, Walmart, target, Barnes n noble, anywhere you’d like that you can have conversations at, looking for someone who seemed to like the conversation no matter what your topic of conversation was. 

For me I’m a car guy, I’m into art so tattoos and games I’d go to places I can relate with others before ever mentioning anything.. so for example I show up to a target and I’m in the Games/Electronic section and see someone who (forgive me for judging off someone looks) holding themselves high, or looks like they would keep a conversation going or friendly, I’d go talk with them see how they’re doing seeing what they’re looking to buy and sincerely ask them what they enjoy what type of games and so on. 

But here’s where it gets a little off putting being out of the business now I see, it is leading someone in a direction you want them to. 

We talk say about 5 minutes or so if they seem nice and cool I’ll ask something along the lines of “so do you game long nights? Or does work usually interfere with wanting to game the hours you want?” And now I’ve opened up the topic of work without have even brought up “hey would you like to leave your 40-60 hr work week to .. so on” and most likely all jobs usually being 9-5s or early starts they’ll say, “yeah I’d like to, but usually my shifts start at 7 or 8. So I game after work when I can” so now the topic of work is there you’re no longer bringing in a subject out of the blue or left field and put their thoughts in a mode of suspicion that you’re tryna sell something. 

You then respond in the lines of, “oh I completely understand, my job is ___ (in my case construction) I work from 5 Am to 3 and drive 60 miles one way, so don’t get home til late and never get to game much anymore, and what do you do for work? If you don’t mind me asking?” Now someone willingly tells you their work title or name. Truck driver, postman, retail, so on. 

Now you can ask them if they like it there or not. “If I may ask? Do you enjoy your job? Do you see yourself staying in that field of work?” And usually the response is no sometimes its a yes or an “I actually don’t mind it” or if it’s a career they studied they’re usually happy, if they say No, now is your option if you want to “share the opportunity” with them. Saying something along the lines of, “hey I completely understand how you feel, I felt the same way.” and you share your own version of how you joined WWDB without mentioning a name, or business except your uplines names and uplift them on how they’ve helped you and how long you’ve come. 

Example: “Hey man, I completely understand how you feel, I work tireless hours, just to come home, eat, sleep and do it all again. I was grateful enough to have met some friends who are actually helping me build an asset that will help me replace my income, to be able to walk away from my work and help me build a better relationship with my __ (GF/Fiancée/wife/BF/Husband/significant Other) and change the way we were taught work should be from schools, to learn how to invest in ourselves.” 

Now depending on their response is how I’d proceed. 

If their answer was “Oh, okay.” Or something similar, sounding like they weren’t interested, I tell them, “hey I’m sorry, I know that’s a lot coming from left field. Sounds weird, I know but I felt the same until they took me under their wing to learn what they’ve learned.” 

If same or no response I go back into the games or whatever topic we initially started with and then move along after wishing them a happy day and leaving them not feeling pressured. (That’s what was my main thing I never wanted to be pushy) 

If there answer was anything along the lines of “that’s cool, or awesome” and showed interest I’d ask, is there any possibility you’d be open to looking at other opportunities professionally outside of your work? 

If no, “okay no worries figured I’d ask” end the conversation and go. 

If yes, “oh awesome! Are you comfortable sharing contact information, so we can get together, and talk about potentially getting you around the people I know?” 

If yes cool you set up an appointment to meet with them and share with them on that day about WWDB. 

If no, I’d say, “hey I understand giving contact info to a stranger is sometimes weird but if there’s no way for me to contact, I would understand you aren’t interested.” And end your convo and leave...

I hope that explains how WWDB at leasts talks to others cause one thing I will say and it’s not me trying to uplift a company that messed me up but, they did get me to be more extroverted than I ever was, which has helped me today, 

but it is deceiving if they ask “oh well what is it?” And you don’t answer the question fully by telling them oh it’s Amway (cause WWDB is only the training/leadership side of it) but we never say it’s Amway, cause it turned everyone away, 

you’d say something more along the lines of “It’s a training program that’s been around for over 50 years with leaders in self development and business, with family grounded beliefs” at least that’s what I’d say. 

If they asked again “like what do they do?” I’d respond with “It’s not really my place to tell someone else’s story of how they found success, I can potentially get you around them if you’re truly interested, and they can explain how they’ve gotten to where they are today.” 

And that’s what made me feel more and more secluded. The more I said that, the worse I felt about being in this “Business” although they had truly helped me build confidence, build my speech and get me out there speaking with others, I couldn’t force someone how I’ve heard and seen on these threads. 

I never built it more than 5 people at a time as my downline.. I couldn’t force people it just wasn’t right and I guess I had doubts from the start ... 

hope that helps I know it’s lengthy but that’s a full run down of a regular “Dropping the message” or “Sharing the Opportunity” in WWDB, 

and you’d often go back and tell your upline how those convos went and they’d say oh change this or don’t say this or say that. And they’d mold you to “perfect” the way you spoke with others. 

Carry yourself high, because the opportunity you present to them is life changing, it’s their choice for not wanting to know. You can only offer them the Blue or Red Pill, you can’t tell them which to take... that’s how they saw it.. 

The Money Side of things:

WWDB would talk down amway on its own. It uses its products but no one had business foundations like WWDB because we were taught build a firm foundation and duplicate it.

Meaning help and find 6 people at a time to build an “Eagle” they had a term for having 6 people under your business “double eagle” just means 12 people under your business.

When you became “Eagle” your business was more likely to succeed because you had enough people in “different legs” they called them instead of saying down lines. 

Each “Leg” represented a different business

Each person sponsored under you was a whole new business and now supported your business they were your downline legs. 

Having 6 meant you were going to be able to produce a certain amount of volume for YOUR business as a total 

(Example of PV. Point Value)
Each 3 dollars usually meant 1 point value.

Meaning spend about 300 dollars usually you’d get about 150PV (but 150PV is AVERAGE)
You’re not an average business so you spend Appx 600 or so to make 300PV because 300 is the minimum a business builder does to build a solid business

This being said your downline should always duplicate your efforts as long as it’s in their budget or they should find better paying jobs to make up for the PV they can’t buy or sell more products to get that amount of PV

that being said your standards of PV per business is 300PV for WorldWide and 150PV for amway’s 

So when you do 150PV, to meet legal requirements and be a legit business with profits and sales you need minimum 50PV in sales but 150PV total is the bare minimum goal. To get any return back. (You do 100 and sell 50 or you sell an entire 150 worth) 

When you do 150PV your total return is 3% of 100 (they have brackets on how much you get in return depending on your PV) adding up to average $30/mo in return for 150PV

When you do 300PV your total return is 6% of 300 adding up to $180/mo in return for 300PV

For easy math I’ll add them up with 500PV (notice: the return brackets are % in increments of 3% by PV example; 3% of 100, 6% of 300, 9% of 600, 12% of 1000, 15% of 1500, 18% of 2500, 21% of 4000. Then changes at 6000PV and up you then get 23% of 6000, 25% of 7500)

There’s “Pin Levels” determined by your PV in which your pins are the increments from 150-6000PV Pin

It isn’t until you reach 7500PV where you’ve now gone from a pin level determined by PV and now get the name “Platinum” you first go “Silver” by reaching 7500PV for one month then go “Gold” for maintaining 7500/mo for 3 months. Until you reach 6 Months consistent at 7500PV you earn “Platinum” your bonuses now are determined by 25% of 7500 and have exclusive yearly bonuses ranging from 1% of 10000 ($1,000), 3% of 12500 ($3,750), and 4% of 15000 ($6,000), and paid trips you will get yearly from amway. 

Okay so now that payment bonuses have been discussed let go back to you building it

So now that you’ve been able to do your minimum (500PV) and have 6 “Legs”(businesses) under you your WHOLE business PV accumulates to you, you’re the one that helped THEM reach their minimum you should be rewarded.

You have 500PV and the other 6 have their respectable 500PV each. Adding up to 2,500PV for the whole “Team” as they’d call it when you refer to your down lines.

What this means, is the return investment per month is no longer $180/mo for just you anymore you now you earned 2,500PV as a leader of the group you’ve moved up in the brackets putting you at 18% of 2500 giving you $450/mo for helping others make $180/mo for themselves.

Their $180 doesn’t come from your total of 450 Amway pays them separately for making minimum PV of 500 leaving them in the 300 PV bracket because the next one isn’t until 600. (But again I’m doing 500 PV each for easy math)

So now $450/mo isn’t gonna get you out of work but it’s an “extra” 450 you made (that’s how they say it, and honestly it gets you believing it too)

So now you go DOUBLE EAGLE again just meaning there’s 12 business under you instead of 6 using the same 500PV example:

Your business totals out to be 15,00 PV for your business 

NOW! You’ve entered a new bracket called Ruby, a new bracket that now goes to 2% of 1500 adding to be $3,000/mo. Plus your yearly bonus ranging about $10k and a “Ruby” bonus ranging ($9,000) Once again you earn your 3k your team each earns their respectful $450

By now this is where everyone is seeing money coming in and “reeling you in” to join the business you could earn 3k/mo on the side of your current job and have about 10k/yr bonus? Adding to an additional $36,000-$46,000 to your current income? All you have to do is HELP others?

Let’s get into the biggest Pin change you can get Diamond (but not the final there’s still higher pin levels, there’s Double Diamond and so on and there’s pins from ruby to Diamond such as sapphire and emerald) Sapphire is you helping 1 on your team become platinum, Emerald is you helping 3 on your team become platinum

Diamond! Which means you’ve helped 6 legs under you reach “Platinum” 
Your business is booming your team saw you make 3K they want 3K

You now have 6 legs under you making their own 7,500 PV and you have your own 7,500 PV on the side you add up a total of 52,500 PV.
Now making it 6% of 52,500 = $31,500/Mo.
So now your making $378,000/Yr on the side, can you replace your job? Maybe, is it good money? Yes. Is it possible? (they always say yes) but reality is it doesn’t happen often.

Of course we’d all love 30k a month who wouldn’t!!!? But sadly this is the level that everyone celebrates and hopes to get into and I physically saw 2 family’s I know and met get there yet, hundreds of others never did. 

The money being flashed in your face makes you wanna stay every time you hear it, every time you see it, and seeing others get to it makes you wanna stay.. trust me that’s why I did. If I could get 300k a year I wouldn’t be driving my 2005 Acura, hoping I’ll have enough to bring my dad back from Mexico legally. Yet these guys are out buying planes and houses CASH.. it’s crazy to think there’s a lot of money there, yet it’s our fault if we don’t pursue it because we aren’t willing to put the “WORK” they did.. I know you didn’t ask for the money breakdown but that’s what kept me going back. That and the fact they actually got me to be more outgoing ... but never sinking into it again. 

Hope this helps get insight on what you wanted to see",7,29,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/k1or70/recruiting_tactics_earnings_pitch/
WWDB/Amway 2015-2020,"Hey Reddit, this is my story and experience with World Wide Dream Builders (WWDB)/ Amway. The story IS lengthy but I am sure it can help out others for things to look out for, and also some positive things I ended up learning as I left. The story is about a 5 year span of being involved.
I lost money, I lost friends, I lost my fiancée. I learned how they focused on “business” more than someone’s well being. I was introduced at 20 years old and left at 25.. there’s both positive and negative but it’s my life. I hope it can help someone else out!

(Age 20)
Hey everyone so I had been with my GirlFriend since 2012 for about almost 2 years before we were introduced to WWDB around late 2014 early 2015. (GF & I both 20 at the time) My best friend(M23) was going out with my GF’s sister(F22) so we stayed in touch often and hung out all the time. My GF’s sister had told my GF about a meeting we could go to. but GF had to work late so couldn’t go and asked if I would go. Sadly enough I am a people pleaser and don’t know how to reject others and told her I would check it out just for her. I saw the meeting and to my surprise there were things I actually agreed with, but I will explain why I “bought” into it. 

Backstory
(Age 19)
Prior to the “Business” I went to a technical school right after highschool to learn automotive collision and paint repair. That’s my background of work, But quickly realized at 19 I make good money just don’t like taking orders. So I would love to have my own traditional business one day. My GF was a Medical Assistant who also made good money but felt the same of not wanting to work for others our whole lives but for ourselves. We had already been invited to these meetings before but I’m skeptical for good reasons and they didn’t like that I questions things so never pushed for it much. For example they had asked me once “Would You rather work for a job you hate for 5 years and never have to work again or work at a job you love for the rest of your life” and I’d ask well why do I hate the 5 years one? I’m willing to go through things for results but why can’t I do the one I love for 5? And so on.. well

(age 20)
At the “MEETING” that night I was introduced to Brad Duncan, a “self made” millionaire country boy from Montana. Worked construction until he replaced his income and never worked a day in his life afterwards. He stated society is made up by 3/3: 1/3 live miserably, 1/3 are complacent 1/3 are go getters and make things happens

He also explained we are a product of our association, which I’d agree with. All my friends are pot smokers, I’m not. All my friends are drinkers, I’m not. I started to think I didn’t fit in and knowing “Leadership” is what they kept talking about I figured I’d love to know more!

My best friend who had invited us quickly hands me a book the next morning, “Business Of The 21st Century” I zoomed right through it and thought HELL YEAH! I always knew you needed networking to build a brand, why not a business? They set up the “Follow Up” or “2nd Look” meeting this time my best friend and my GFs sister are at the meeting and brought their upline to explain it to me. The questions he asked me made me think differently about the whole thing. He asked “If you owned a Gas Station, and your gas cost $5 a gallon and your competitor’s (chevron/shell) was $3 a gallon where would you fuel up?” To my honesty I answered “If I own the gas station, then mine.” He asked me “why?” I told him “because if the gas station is mine even tho its pricier the earnings go to me.” It’s basic business 

He lit up in joy and told me awesome so you understand how to respect your own company and so on and so on, went to another meeting took my GF and both agreed we wanted to join, bless my naive self I jumped into it. Bringing my GF along because she believed in me.

About a month in We went to our first “Major Function” as they call it (major business meeting that runs all weekend as a leadership conference) I remember being excited cause we were taking a road trip, plus my GF and I rarely get to see each other much cause I was so focused on work and getting us living out of our parent’s homes and getting us to a “better life” and we’re driving up to Portland Oregon. From Northern California (Bay Area) it would be a good 12 hour-ish trip.

We spend the weekend and I learned a lot, what I wanted most was the family that stuck together, I had a broken home. My brother didn’t speak with me because his wife didn’t like me or my GF, (we lived in the same household) my parents were divorced when I was 12 (had depression/was suicidal) and my father was deported a year prior to being in the business. Me seeing that I can make money and possibly fix our financial problems I was excited, immediately told my GF I was going to give it my all, and make a great life for us.

My upline had encouraged us to get “better jobs” with better Business building hours to support myself and my business with more income to have more “PV” (point value, more consumables mor points) as that is the way to make more money later on. Also business building hours were relatively morning jobs giving you 9-5 for work and 6-12 for business. I agreed and left my Collision repair work to work in Construction. I joined the Union for SheetMetal and HVAC. This is where things started to change...

I always knew construction was tough but this is something I wasn’t ready for, but they kept saying I was building character and growth because I was out of my comfort zone.

I live in Concord CA and drove to San Jose CA EVERYDAY to just go to work. Work was 10-12 hour days and 6 days a week given the job site I was at offered overtime. Avg of 50-60ish miles One-Way to get to work I started to leave earlier for work to avoid traffic and would get home late because not being able to avoid traffic. I started to build a gap between my GF and I and my upline would say it’s all worth it, use your drive home as a way to connect and meet new people (approach and try to recruit) 
I woke up every morning at 2AM left home at 3 would get to work at 4 had just about and hour before work at 5AM. I got off at 2:30 and caught all the traffic and would get home at 5-6PM AVG. 
I was too tired to visit My GF so I’d text and chat with her until 7:30-8 and had to fall asleep for the next day.

I was in a Union Apprenticeship, meaning I had to go to classes to earn more and level out to be a “Journeyman”. Some of those classes were 100% mandatory failure to arrive meant you lost credit and would remain the level of apprentice you were, or in my case “Pre-Apprentice” meaning you work as a laborer for the company in hopes the company trains you until you go to the classes and be able to earn more money.

Every time a big Night Class would happen allowing me to go into a higher Apprentice level, I’d advise him, “hey I have a night class I have to go to, it’ll help me get a higher apprenticeship” and his response was “if you’re a leader and a business owner, you won’t miss these meetings” once again being a people pleaser and not knowing how to reject the “guidance” of my upline I would fail to show up remaining at a lower level apprenticeship and losing on possible income for going to a meeting that was just another (recruit meeting) I had been to several what would the difference be? 

(Age 22 turning 23)
So by now I’m in the business 3 years or so, alienated friends because they didn’t understand our path, or mission, learned self development and leadership. I though I was growing in great ways, even though I had lost my friends. I sold my game consoles to focus on business, bought suits, ties, dress shoes, to fit this “Business Builder” attire. Had worked 10-12 hr days at my job, and went to spend another 2-4 at night to build my business. I was tired out. Was losing my GF and knew we were growing distant.

As I’m driving to work my body was so fatigued I fell asleep driving, I hit a dumpster truck and hit the center divider. Totaled my car. Final thoughts were, maybe this drive isn’t worth the money, I know how to do auto body repair way greater than construction anyway, I can do something else. I’m killing myself... told my GF my thoughts of leaving construction to get closer to her again to be closer to home and not kill myself working tireless hours. She supported me and against my upline’s thoughts that I should stay in construction even giving the fact I had that accident. I came home.

This was the first doubts I had of this “business”. He said you’re fine, you’ll heal, thank God that you’re healthy and will heal and continue to build. It rubbed me the wrong way so much I started to have doubts but never mentioned them to anyone..

About 3 weeks later my mother gets into a horrible car accident where both of my grandparents (my moms parents) pass away in the accident. On their way to Mexico going towards Arizona passing by Needles CA. Where my mom was the driver. Oooooh it broke everyone apart. My mom was having anxiety couldn’t drive and everything. Well given the fact the police were trying to test my mother as suicidal and failing to kill herself tried to put her for attempted murder cause she couldn’t control the car.. I couldn’t handle what to do I asked for guidance and all I got in response was “Dig Your Well Before You’re Thirsty” build a way to have money for situations like these where you can support everything and not worry on GoFundMe accounts and all of those things. Once again rubbed me the wrong way and didn’t create a GoFundMe out of fear of criticism from old friends and “Business Partners” yet my upline or “leaders” couldn’t help me financially.. but I was in their prayers thank god for that...

(Age 23/24)
I’m back in autobody for another year and things between my GF and I were getting “Better” so I thought. We spent more time together, we’d share more to each other reading relationship books I knew how to treat her with respect and not demand things that wouldn’t help our relationship.. I praised her as my queen. Who she was worthy of having that title to me. Well..

I was moved into upper management in autobody from working on the cars to the office and ordering parts and was promised an Estimator position being what I wanted because I was tired of killing my body and I was only 24 and my body couldn’t take hard labor anymore. (Yes I am an overweight guy people thought that’s the only reason but no, spend 4-5 hours on your knees plus being overweight kills you) 
My job hypes me up for my next promotion and transfer to a closer location and ... BOOM laid off here’s your 3 Checks and done... what happens next? I tell my upline and get the same
“Build your well” shit and it got me angry yet understood all jobs are temporary and always felt that way even prior to WWDB so I said forget it, if it was gonna happen it happened for a reason.

By this time My Best friend had now married my GFs sister, (they were together 2 years before my GF and I got together) and now had promised my GF I would soon propose we had always talked about marriage. Moving out, and wanting to be a family. But there were flaws.
Instead of buying my GF a ring, I put the money into the business, knowing I had just lost my job and was driving for Lyft, she knows I’ll get it soon. I had promised for 2 years now to be married. But it hadn’t happened.

(Age 24)
My upline once again tries to help by getting me a job to make more money. Which I really needed because lyft pays ok if you put massive hours.. he got me hired with AAA as Emergency Roadside Assistance, In other words Towing.

I had finally saved up enough to buy a ring for my GF and was setting up to surprise her on a big trip to LA where her sister and my best friend were going to announce their pregnancy and figured I’d join as well at the end of the trip and propose! 

Her and I have a disagreement because I was a new hire at a job and could only get a couple days off work where she wanted to stay longer, and out of the sake of keeping her happy I told her go and spend the 4th of July with your family I’ll be here when you get back but i had secretly wanted to propose at Disneyland with the fireworks...

She came back differently, I spoke with my upline about proposing and said it was long overdue. I explained the reason things were long overdue were because I had been so focused on building this business any left over money I had went to this and not the saving I wanted to have by this age.. I had no longer thought of a “fairy tale” proposal and now didn’t feel like she felt certain of our relationship anymore. We were together from our Senior year August of 2012 up to current year July 2019. On our way home from a meeting I pulled over and asked her to talk. I proposed and she cried.. she told me she had waited for that moment for so long that she no longer thought it would happen. She didn’t know what to say and if yes was even the answer for her anymore.. 
we brought up how far apart we were from each other now, being that the towing job gave me the complete opposite of a schedule she had
She worked early mornings, I worked late nights, I saw her 1 day out of the week. How could we live a life where our communication had completely disappeared. 
Whenever I’d call while I was at work, she was busy building the business and trying to recruit. Whenever I was off, I was “building”.

I told her I wouldn’t pressure her but we would fix things if she’d like and that my dream was to get married.. we split up for a week to think things out, she called me to talk and said yes and I was full of joy, she said she didn’t want to do this alone that we had already invested almost 7 years together ..

Right before our 7 year anniversary she said she didn’t feel it anymore, the more we tried the more I just felt like a friend who just was there all the time now, she loved me just not like that anymore. She said we had fallen out of love...

She returned the ring and I couldn’t handle the pain.. My uplines only response was now you can focus on growing yourself and build this! Which only frustrated me more... I started to realize I can no longer talk to anyone about what had just happened because I had alienated all my bestest friends.. I spent more time with her family that now I felt like I had lost them too.. I felt empty. I got depressed (given the fact I was suicidal/depressed in 7th grade when my parents divorced) I was worried my mind would turn to such negative thoughts. I reached out to friends and apologized cause I didn’t know what to do, they all thought her and I would live the rest of our lives together, “we had it so great” yet they didn’t know We had both put an MLM before our own relationship...

Her 25th birthday was coming up, August 17th, and I had already arranged flowers to arrive at her door, with a note that I wish I hadn’t attached but let it happen anyways. It was a note thanking her for being the love of my life and how glad I was that we were finally engaged.. and well when I had purchased the order for the flowers I didn’t know all this would happen..

I sent her a BDay text. Continued with my day, she wouldn’t let me take her for dinner so I stayed away. Hard enough to break up with her, any “meeting” I went to was hosted at my Best Friends and her Sisters house so I constantly saw her.. I was breaking myself seeing her and didn’t know how to stay out of the business. Cause I’m my eyes I can build my future and never have to work these jobs that have drained me physically and mentally.. and have dealt with people who scar me emotionally.

(Age 25) 
My birthday was finally here, August 26th. 
She hadn’t said anything to me all day, no text no call. I had figured I’m on my own today. 
On My birthday there was a night meeting and I showed up.. stayed away from anyone and was told by my upline he was proud of me on how much I’ve grown in the span of 5 years in the business. I was a mature man at 25, who can put things aside and remain profesional when it came to my ex gf now becoming my down line instead of my life partner..

It no longer sat well with me.. and now the meetings became repetitive non sense that I knew would apply somewhere else with better intentions. That same year I was so lost without her I was going through my first break up since highschool. I didn’t know how to handle it. She was my first and ONLY partner I had been with. So it made me feel connected cause she was my first love.. couple months pass, and I figured you know what I’m gonna get back into what I enjoy.

Bought me a used console started gaming again, got back into watching movies, and Into making music. 

Only bad thing about it, anytime my sponsor would ask why I wasn’t “Growing” business wise, I felt like I had to hide the fact that actually I’m having fun right now, I’m 25 and have lost 5 years of my life that I now want to enjoy. Again I’m a people pleaser so it’s very hard for me to explain to others I don’t want to do what you want to do, out of fear of them not wanting to remain around me.

Christmas comes and passes we are now entering 2020

I’m still working for AAA and still driving about 30 min to work and although it supports me I know AAA isn’t where I wanna spend the rest of my life. I’m still in the business and hesitant to proceed. My ex and I always wanted to move to Vacaville CA since it was closer to living around our upline... I make the decision to move and end up renting a single room with a bathroom from a family my upline knows, and was supposed to help me greatly. I’m single now making OK money supporting my own expenses and only lasted about 3 months in that household because of rules the mom had and feeling uncomfortable of being 25 and her having a 17 year old daughter with her friends around inviting me to the pool. I left and came back to my moms house... and agreed to help in whatever I could.. 

When I told my upline I was leaving he said I was making a mistake because I didn’t let that household be my actual home, because I constantly came to my moms and spent nights out here to come visit friends.. I was no longer focused on the business 100%
And I agreed.. I told him hey “you told me you’d always support me and be there for me no matter what my decision was” and he said yes, then I told him okay, I’m going home, and staying away for now... I’ll listen to some audios but I’m just not gonna be in this environment anymore... I still love you, you’ve been an older brother to me.. when I really needed one. But I need to fix my mental health and my emotional health. And most important my physical health..

(Age 26)
August 2020
Pandemic had started, meetings were over Zoom and I no longer was around the environment of “Crossline” and “upline” because we can’t be friends outside the business, I could potentially undue someone’s “work” ...
But no longer felt this need to act like everything was okay when things weren’t.
I had distanced myself enough to realize who were my true friends.. 
I slowly realized my brother (who had now fixed our relationship) had now been doing filmography, he went from car salesman to loan sales, to insurance broker, when he got his insurance license he was recruited to Primerica, and had red lights all over, and told him if he was going to get in there was plenty of things he had to know up front about MLMs (my brothers wife had filed for divorce and was going through an extreme break up of 10+ years and I knew exactly how he felt, and being told he didn’t have to work his whole life would be what reeled him in) I explained hey man, you got this photography and film thing going for you, why don’t you stick to that? Put your all Into that? 

I always had music as a hobby. Since I was 14 I had messed with music engineering and production but never took it seriously. My friend who is an artist wanted to take his music serious and spoke to my brother, hey dude if we put the same energy we put into building an MLM we can make it a success for our music, our photography and art that we already know how to do..

So to conclude my 5 years of MLM involvement I took out the greater things from it. 

I got sucked in by the Leadership aspect of things cause I always looked up to guys who motivate and tell you how it is like Gary Vee, and such people. 

I regained most of my alienated friends who forgave me and realized I have grown in good aspects of life, I’m only human and fell into ways perfected to get you to rethink of your own life choices.

I’m single but am living happily doing what I enjoy, gaming watching movies and started losing weight, (Starting weight was 275) went down to 230, 

started and ACTUAL business with my brother and a different best friend from middle school. Music Production / Film studio And took all my knowledge I learned from taxes and actual business points and development they tried to give me as I was doing an MLM.. 

My best friend from the story had gotten into a bad mountain bike accident, and I reached out. The sad thing was not my old upline not my best friends wife not my ex gf told me about it. 
My ex girlfriends dad was the one who told me.
Anytime I reached out they told me they’d keep me updated. Which they didn’t...
I slowly started to feel like they didn’t want me around.. they had a go fund me account which I donated to out of my heart and knowing they’re family to me... I got no update. I reached out to him after he was doing better to see when I can visit and he told me he’d reach out.. it’s been 3 weeks or so he’s been out of the hospital and have yet to receive an update.. I said happy birthday to each of them. And only received a bday text from my ex... I realized I should have to try and stay. When they weren’t giving me the time of day..

I hope this gives someone hope, or anyone who’s in an MLM still and wondering if they should get out..
I crept on r/AntiMLM when I had my doubts and agreed with some but didn’t make the move I recently saw the r/MLMRecovery sub and felt I had to post my story!

Thank you for reading and wish you all success, after MLMs have messed with our heads..",21,24,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/k0ev1m/wwdbamway_20152020/
SCAMWAY - THE SCHEME OF SELLING DREAMS (DOCUMENTARY IN PROGRESS),"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5mnqqn5pnby51.png?width=5400&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bc0e9554080562ad4e60c9bf79180d498c9730d

Hello everyone,

I am a filmmaker, currently working on a documentary titled **""Scamway - The Scheme of Selling Dreams**"" that I was inspired to make after being approached to start a ""business"" through Amway. I had heard of the company previously but didn't quite understand what it was or why in the world they would want me to start a business with them. So, I went to a meeting (on Zoom) with two individuals from ""LTD"". At first the opportunity, of course, sounded great but at the same time something about it felt off. After the first meeting, I made some phone calls to friends and family trying to see if anyone had been approached or even worked for this company before. To my surprise, my grandparents use to sell Amway back in the '90s and lost tons of money doing it.

This is when my research got deeper and this documentary came to life. After reading about the lawsuits, stories from other people who had been sucked into their trap, and some of the sketchiness surrounding certain individuals who work for Amway, I decided to stick with LTD's process. I went to countless Zoom meetings, presentations, read a couple of their recommended books, listened to their podcasts, and so on. I went through this process to help create this documentary, so I had the first-hand experience in the process of LTD, their tactics to recruit people, how their structure works, and to somewhat understand what they are doing. (They like to talk very broad so sometimes it's hard to follow)

The best part was I did this all through Zoom, had access to the LTD apps, and got behind the scenes of how the website now works...and yes, I recorded all of this. (Expect the first meeting because I had no idea what it even was) I am still currently doing more research to gather as much information as possible and thought maybe this wonderful community would like to help out! I've read through a lot of people's stories on here but would love to have a thread with people who wouldn't mind their story/information they have about Amway being shared in the documentary.

If you would like to be apart of this documentary please share any information or stories you have here. You can also email me at: [scamwaydoc@gmail.com](mailto:scamwaydoc@gmail.com) if you don't want to share on here. If you are interested in even doing a Skype/Zoom call or phone call that is also something I am looking to add to this documentary. 

I will continue to keep this community updated on the progress of this film and am extremely thankful for anyone who shares their stories with me. If you have any questions about the film or my experience personally let me know!",10,55,,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/jrc2h2/scamway_the_scheme_of_selling_dreams_documentary/

Amway/WWDB,"I joined this community a few weeks ago and it really has helped me come to terms with my experience with amway and WWDB.  My time with both organizations was just a year but the mental scaring is still with me.

It all started in the spring of 2018. I worked overnights at a restaurant and ended up serving Brad Duncan along with a few other major people in his organization. I was new to Vegas, a single mom, just broke up with my boyfriend and was essentially an easy target. It all started with Brad complimenting me on how articulate I was when I spoke and then through out them dining, i was complimented several times by a beautiful young girl who took a lot of interest in me. She asked me if i liked what i was doing and if i was open to other opportunities. She told me that Brad had just bought a plane, that he was connected with companies like Apple and Nike and that i definitely wanted to stay in touch. She told me she knew the city well and could show me around since i was new. At this point, it’s 3am I’m dealing with drunk people all night and then when they came in, complimenting me, being incredibly nice, it was a breath of fresh air so when she asked for my number, i obliged. I googled Brad Duncan after they left and couldn’t find anything on him so i thought nothing of it again. 

A week later, the girl calls me while I’m at work (mind you i worked two jobs, one over night and one during the day so i was always tired and looking for a way out) and asks if I’m available to meet for coffee. I thought it was weird but figured why not. My schedules was pretty tight but after moving it around a little bit, we agreed to meet at a local coffee shop. When I get there, she starts the first part of the process. Asking me if i know what a brick and mortar is. Asking if i know what an asset is. Random questions that seemed like they could be legitimate interview questions. Before leaving, she gave me a book and asked me if i could show up to this super exclusive presentation. I was hesitant but again moved around my schedule. She was so nice and carried herself in a successful way. At this point, I’m probably looking like a great candidate to her as well. In fact, at one point her and her husband told me how i was the perfect person to go through the process because i just listened to them without questioning them much (i know, but like i said, i was new in town, freshly single, i was a mess in the head). After going to this presentation ( it was in a church  garage packed to the brim with people dressed in business attire) i was sold the dream. I drank the koolaid. They did everything in their power to make sure i didn’t turn back. Right before i “launched” my business, my car had gotten broken into, all my cards stolen and they assured me that this is just the resistance that everyone goes through and to just have faith that it would all be ok. Looking back, i see all the red flags but it really seemed liked they were some type of blessing. They really drove home the idea that if you wanna be successful, you gotta know successful people and them being emeralds in the business, certainly gave the illusion that they were successful. Honestly, it was the motivational books and audios that really got me. It had me the single mother, working 2 jobs, feelings like i could escape my miserable life and help others along the way. Ugh. Vomit. 

Anyway, after launching my business, that’s when the real manipulation started happening. You’re required to go to two meetings a month, and all major “functions”. You have to listen to audios and check in with your up line daily. Essentially they keep you “plugged in” ya know, all the makings of brainwashing.  You’re required to spend in excess of $600 to attain the 200 pv that was required to be “honoring the partnership”. Spending that much a month on amway products made it so that i had to keep both of my jobs . I was encouraged to pay my rent and car payment late every month because me “ditto” order should come first. I was encouraged to spend nothing outside of the business. I was encouraged to move the area i lived in to be closer to them. I was constantly stressed out and feeling guilty. The gaslighting never stopped. The list of ways you have to “honor” the partnership was ridiculous. Whenever I would stop honoring the partnership, the wife would pull me in closer. Try to bond with me and my daughter. One time she Invited me on Brad Duncan’s plane. I didn’t go because i was becoming more aware of what the hell was going on. They would say anything to keep me feeling like there was a way i could do well in the business.  Eventually i decided that i couldn’t do it anymore. I was in way worse shape than when i started. My credit score was ruined. I wasn’t into it. I was never gonna make money because i wasn’t really into it. So i blocked my uplines number and never looked back. That was June of 2019


For a year I struggled with whether or not i made the right decision. Amway is rampant here and my current boyfriend’s sister is heavily involved. I struggled with thinking that maybe, just maybe i dropped the ball. UNTIL I found this community. The posts I’ve read here have helped me so so so much.  I have never spoken about my experience out loud but i am so happy that i escaped that nightmare.",24,70,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/ia4ogo/amwaywwdb/
"They called us ""excuse makers"" because we didn't want to go to their huge conference during a pandemic","This is my first time posting. I mostly just wanted to find a place to type this out, but advice is welcome!

My fiance was in an MLM (Amway). I have not been totally onboard with the idea since he joined. At first, he was very excited about it. They sold him all of these dreams of ""financial freedom"". They also told him that being in Amway would help him become free of his job so that he would have more time to spend with me and his family. However, to me it always seemed that his time was being taken away more than ever. 

He was once told that he had to give up visiting me (we lived 3 hours away from each other when he first started) if he wanted to be successful. He was also told by his mentor/upline (whatever) that I was a non-believer and an excuse maker. It was said that I was too outspoken and not supportive of his business. I may have not liked the idea of Amway, but I did want to support Fiance's decision. I spent $300+ a month on products to help him reach his point goals so that he wouldn't be belittled at their next meeting. He would spend more than that a month himself.

If we didn't meet the goal for the month, we were told that we ""didn't want it enough"" or we were ""lazy, excuse makers"". Fiance would let this get to him and start putting more and more into his business. He would also expect me to do more too. He confided in me that his upline told him to demand me to go to conference with him. As said before, I am not the type of woman to be demanded to do anything. This business definitely did not set well with me after this. When I went to meetings after that, the women would treat me differently (not that they really accepted me to begin with, they didn't even remember my name most of the time). They would always try to talk to me about the bible and how we should let the men in our lives lead us. I was just disgusted by their views on this. 

The final straw for my fiance was this past month. The team he was a part of did not allow IBOs to attend meetings via Zoom if they lived within at least a three hour range. He only lives an hour away from the team, but didn't feel comfortable going to a crowded meeting due to COVID-19. He is an essential worker and I am a teacher, so neither of us want to risk our jobs. The team leader (his upline) was upset that we didn't show up, even after telling him we weren't. We were also belittled because we didn't go to the conference with 1000's of other people.

The whole experience made me feel like a slimy sewer rat when I would have to go to places with fiance to ""contact"" people. It always felt wrong.",19,87,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/i86rl1/they_called_us_excuse_makers_because_we_didnt/

And I just saw some other post on reddit where they explain how MLM is basically a scam. I was shocked about how clueless I was. I sent him a sc for him to know what he's dealing with, but he wouldn't consider any of that. He started acting so ignorant. I'm scared for him becoming a ""cultist"" as those guys called them.

I am posting because I've told nobody that I've left. I'm still in all the group chats and getting updates on whatever is happening. What do I do?

As with most MLM schemes. A friend brought me in but I didn't tell the friend that I left. And those that brought my friend in were telling to bring in people.

How do I proceed from here. There's a telegram groupchat, a messanger groupchat and the forex related stuff.

I lost my best friend to a MLM scheme.,"My ex boyfriend/ best friend of 6 years who is 24 years old has recently been working for what I believe to be a MLM scheme for the past 5 months, a company by the name of Credico. When he first started I didn't know much about it, in fact I didn't even think it was going to last this long. I noticed the insane amount of hours he was working 6-7 days a week from 9am up to 10pm. He went to work in a rented out office, and from there he would be transported to be on his feet for 11 plus hours selling Xfinity in various Walmarts. Since he's started this job I haven't been hearing from him as often as I used to and it started to concern me, anytime I asked a question his answer seemed so scripted, its like he was brainwashed. He needed sales in order to get this ""promotion"" I even signed up for Xfinity myself and canceling a few days later just to help him reach his sales goal. He ended up getting the promotion, and a couple weeks ago he had informed me that he was going to be taking a business trip to California (we live in NJ) he's been there for about two weeks doing the same thing, standing outside grocery stores during a global pandemic to sell Xfinity and take calls, he's staying in an air b&b with about 6 other co workers. Last night he dropped the bomb on me that he is coming back to NJ in about a week to pack his stuff because he's moving to California...I was devastated. He told me that they are opening up a new office there and eventually he would open his own, and he would be rooming with 4 of his coworkers. I don't know much about this company, and he's always to busy working to answer my phone calls or questions about whats going on, I quickly became concerned. I started googling credico and found that it was flooded with negativity. I came across this site and I just had to share what I'm dealing with. I feel like I don't know him anymore, he's no longer interested in anything he used to like doing because all of his time is consumed with this ""job"" he rarely calls or texts anymore and I just feel like I overall lost my best friend to this pyramid scheme. Anyone out there have any advice or maybe something I can say to him to snap out of it? or is he just too far gone?",8,55,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/g7yoyy/i_lost_my_best_friend_to_a_mlm_scheme/
My best friend is just getting started with Amway and I want to stop him before he gets in too deep.,"Hey everyone. I browsed a few MLM subs and I think I'd get the best advice here for my problem here. Long story short: one of my best friends is getting involved with Amway and I really want to nip this in the bud before it starts to get bad. The problem is, I've seen conflicting advice here and there that range from ""stay positive and just don't support the business"" to ""be aggressive and upfront about it."" 

He is highly impressionable, and graduated college about a year ago. I would love to hear some personal stories from people who got out (or got their friends/ loved ones). Which of the above approaches worked? Or was it something else they said that resonated with you?

I'm willing to provide more context if this wasn't enough info, and I thank you all in advance.

Why MLMs harm the gay community,"So I went down the MLM rabbit hole and I have decided that MLMs especially younique is responsible for funding the abuse of the gay community.... hear me out.

[ importance of being mormon](https://timelessvie.wordpress.com/2016/05/03/the-importance-of-being-mormon-younique/)

This link will take you to a story about the mormon connection to MLMs and the toxicity it has towards women and the gay community.  Mormon members pay a whopping 10% of their total income, on top of some of these companies being owned by mormon people, they openly talking about preying on mormon women to sell for them because the mormon church shames women into popping out litters of mormon babies and staying home with them.  They introduced ""working from home"" as a ""viable"" option through their companies.  Now here's where the gay abuse thing comes in.  All of those 10% tithings get funneled into the church's many programs (at least what isn't being hoarded by leaders). One of these programs is their ""conversion therapy"". 

[conversion therapy](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/mormon-gay-cures-reparative-therapies-shock-today/story?id=13240700)

A program that is responsible for why young gay mormons have a higher suicide rate than the rest of the community. Utilizing barbaric ""therapies"" that have been abandoned by mainstream mental health organizations decades ago as it was deemed abusive.  Ive also heard stories of false memory planting to make young gay people believe they were sexually abused and that made them gay and they were not born that way and they can be ""fixed"".

So in conclusion supporting MLMs is supporting abuse to the gay community. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",17,39,Resource,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/eztjde/why_mlms_harm_the_gay_community/
Wanted to tell my story,"I’m 37 and last year found out I’m autistic. It’s been a relief to finally know why I’ve always felt different and struggled with things others don’t seem to. 

One of the big struggles I’ve had, line many autistic women, is employment. I also have a learning disability, and so I’ve been fired from jobs in my early adult years. I got my degree and was a high school teacher for 8 years and I was good at the actual teaching but struggled to manage the endless paperwork and record keeping due to autism and dyscalculia. I left the career, defeated and that was actually what set the stage for me finding an answer for my struggles.

Anyways. My last year of teaching was the 2016-2017 year. I was miserable and hated it. I felt stupid, incompetent, and depressed. I had no idea what I was going to do that I could be good at.

Sometime that school year, I ordered a candle from Jewelscent, a company that sells the candles with rings inside. At that time, they had an MLM option only if you sought it out; otherwise, you’d just order from the website. 

I loved the candle and out of curiosity read the part about the “Jewelscent opportunity”. I was intrigued and decided to ask for more information. They hooked me up with an up mine who talked up the business. I was on the fence, and she told me I could just order the starter kit and see how I liked the different products, and see if I liked it from there. So I did. She had me host a Facebook party that actually did really well. I ended up making about $600 commission from it and I was so excited! My up line was so encouraging and the Facebook group for my team built me up so much and told me what amazing potential I had. So I kept going. And I actually can say I DID make money. About an extra $1000 a month. Our orders were all done online so I didn’t ever order extra products.

I was on cloud 9. I’d never been good at anything and here was this group of women telling me how valuable, smart, and talented I was! I’d never been told that. I’d never felt successful at any work. They even convinced me to go to the convention. I felt it odd I had to pay $300 for net he conference and pay for my own travel, hotel, and food, but they assured me it was the only way I could take my business to the next level. So I did. 

I was so brainwashed at said conference! They told us we were in on the ground floor, with it being only a few years old as a company at that time, and that we got in early so we’d climb the ranks. I was so pumped.

But not long after that conference, my sales started dropping. I guess I hadn’t expected that it was really a niche product and people would only buy it once, or twice at the most. I’d already sold to everyone I knew that wanted to.

I asked my team for advice. This is where I started getting that doubt. They tried telling me to give samples to, and try to sell to, the staff at my gym. I told them our gym has a strict no solicitation policy and they told me to just give samples anyways and tell them they could ask more about it if they wanted. I thought it was so shady. I’ve been going to this gym for many years and I wasn’t going to prey on them.

Then they started shaming me because they said I wasn’t trying hard enough. All because I didn’t want to prey on my gym or other places I frequent. 

They went from building me up and making me feel I could do anything to telling me what everyone else in my life has ever told me—that I was struggling because I just didn’t try hard enough. I know now that Jewelscent, as an MLM, is set to fail you; it wasn’t me. But at the time it was the nail in the coffin. At the end of that school year I left teaching because I hated it. I quit the mlm. And started another job, which I’m still doing and very happy at. 

Now that I know I’m autistic, I’m so angry they took advantage of me and I’m embarrassed that autism made me fall for their mind games. I’ll never do an MLM again. I’m ashamed.",9,94,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/enyejy/wanted_to_tell_my_story/

Ex-MLM Perspective,,7,17,Story,https://www.quora.com/Is-Amway-a-fraud-group
"After 5 years in Primerica, I've left that company behind.","At the end of 2013, I had graduated with my bachelor's in education earlier that year, at the time decided that I didn't want to work as a teacher because I had watched my parents divorce, in what at the time seemed to be nasty (it wasn't), and had been dumped before student teaching by my girlfriend of over a year via phone call. I considered therapy, but never pursued it. After graduating, I was working in a grocery store while applying for jobs. Enter a friend from college. She had started as a theater major before switching to a business major in her sophomore year. She reached out to me via Facebook asking if I knew anyone who kept their options open for part-time work or a possible career change. Since I was working a shitty retail job with minimal room for advancement, was vulnerable mentally and emotionally, and generally unaware of what MLM's were, I figured ""why not?""

I go to her Primerica office for their ""corporate overview"" aka their recruiting seminar, which was presented by a middle-aged man who also worked as an ELL (English Language Learners) teacher and one of their Regional Leaders (the position before you get promoted to RVP and have complete control of your downlines/base shop). The overview at the beginning has some basic credibility information listing some of the companies that provide investment services (actively managed mutual funds, fixed and variable annuities), auto insurance referrals, etc as well as some very basic financial information about compound interest and how to pay off debts in a more effective way. The rest of the overview is full-on recruitment and how great your life will be when you've built your Primerica business and how you can be your boss and make as much money as you want.

At the end of the recruitment seminar, I look at Primerica as an opportunity to get both my life producer license and my Series 6/63 (investment licenses) and to go and work at either a bank or another financial company. After joining, I'm told that to get properly trained, I need to introduce my trainer to at least 10 people so they can set appointments for me to observe how to handle prospective clients (this is a ploy for your upline to be able to sell to more people without having to split commission with you). I strongly state that I want to wait until I get licensed before going on training appointments, that way I can get some commission off of any services sold. We eventually sit with my divorced parents (separately) and a few of my friends. My financially savvy parents politely decline the services offered but offer their support for me as they want to see me be successful. During this time, my office's RVP takes notice in me and offers me the opportunity to work as her assistant (I assisted her in placing trades on her clients' investment accounts and tracking client investments). I jumped at this opportunity as I wasn't particularly fond of sales and wanted something that didn't require me to be dishonest or unforthcoming with clients.

With every MLM, they have conventions (which are expensive) and as my RVP's assistant, I'm pressured into attending, even though I'm being paid just above minimum wage and cannot afford the travel, lodging, and food costs associated with a trip like this. These conventions occurred every other year, and can easily cost attendees a minimum of $700. With Primerica, you also have to maintain your insurance and investment licenses, which can easily cost someone $1,000 a year. Factor in travel costs for visiting clients, living expenses, and trying to have a life as someone in their 20's and everything starts to add up. Over the 5 years I worked with Primerica, I went from paying my credit card in full (2013), to 2 credit cards maxed out for close to $15,000 by 2019. I started 2013 with close $1,000 in savings to having $100 in savings at the beginning of 2019.

Throughout 2013-2019, I never felt 100% comfortable working for Primerica, as something always seemed off. In 2017, I was fed up with Primerica and started a job search to find a better and fairer way to earn a living. This caused my RVP and several people in my base shop to stage a perverse intervention to get me to stay, implying that life outside of Primerica will beat you down, and you'll burn out working elsewhere (one of the people in this ""intervention"" burnt out multiple times and would disappear for months on end). After applying to several places (including a few banks) and not getting an interview or hired, I stayed with Primerica, believing the manipulative things I was told. My RVP also promised to give me a livable salary as things improved for her (she lives in a large house, drives a BWM, and sends her children to private school). She stated that I needed to show a better work ethic in order to get this significant pay raise, but never stated explicitly what needed to be done, aside from essentially being on call 24/7.

At the beginning of this year, I was frustrated and broke, living with my dad, and felt hopeless. I started dating a teacher who's absolutely passionate about what she does, and it reignited my passion for teaching. I revamped my resumé and started applying for teaching positions, eventually finding a position at a K-8 school in a city. During this application process, I started working with a therapist as I realized that my mental health had been neglected for years. 2019 has been a great year for me, as I'm now working in a field I love. I make a positive impact on children that need the most help and I'm compensated fairly for my work.

Since I've started teaching, I've been able to more effectively pay off my debts, save more money, and achieve the work-life balance that MLM's attempt to tout. Based off of my current situation, I'll be completely debt-free by the end of 2020 and will be in a financially viable place to start 2021.

TL;DR: Joined Primerica while in a vulnerable place, was emotionally and mentally abused, and went broke over the course of 5 years. Eventually got out and have been rebuilding since September.",24,129,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/ef2h33/after_5_years_in_primerica_ive_left_that_company/
Aunt is selling Younique! Should I be worried?,"Hi everyone! Long time reader and new poster here. I have an aunt, let's call her Karen, who has a full time job, two amazing little boys, a nice husband...and a side business selling makeup. I didn't think anything of it until I fell down the r/antimlm rabbit hole and sure enough, it's Younique. I've done my research and I know they're a shady company, but I don't think aunt Karen knows. But I'm not sure if she's in danger, either. She posts constantly about how great her makeup is, but she doesn't harass the family to get us to buy from her, either. She has her own ""party"" website and she uses WAY too many emojis when she posts/texts, but she doesn't seem to be addicted to the ""hustle"", either.

My question to you, the r/MLMRecovery community, is, when should I start getting REALLY worried? My parents aren't concerned at all and think it's just a fun way for her to get free makeup, but I've done my research, and I'm not so sure. I am not 100% sure of how deep she is into this, but I have a strong suspicion that most of the women following her on FB are hunbots, and since she posts pictures of my nephews with absolutely NO safety concerns (uses full names and everything!) I am worried that if she tries to leave the MLM that something bad could happen to her and my nephews. I've heard how mean people can be when you try to leave. Again, not sure how far gone she is, and not sure how I can ask her or find out without her getting defensive or hunbotty. How can I tell if she's just blissfully ignorant or if she's really drunk the kool-aid? I like Karen a lot and I love my nephews, so I want to know how I can protect them all from the effects of an MLM.

Feel free to post advice, stories, whatever. I'm not good at responding instantly so it may take some time, but i appreciate any interest in my post/story.

EDIT: Wow, didn't expect so much so fast! Thank you all for commenting with such good advice. I'm not quite sure how to break the news to her, but I think I will try to do so after the holidays. I think I will send some information over to her husband (my uncle) and see if he can help me get her outta this.

I recently realized that I’ve been Brainwashed for almost 10 years with MLM and need support/advice about my next steps,"I want to start by saying how grateful I am that I stumbled on Reddit and this sub. I’m new to Reddit but heard about this platform from a new friend I met on Facebook while I was doing “social media marketing”.

I went on to create an account and posted a “business opportunity” in a sub that pertained to the product that I was selling. (The product I was selling truly changed my life so I was very passionate about it which is making this very difficult for me and why I’m choosing to be vulnerable and seek support from this group.) I was surprised and taken aback when someone posted an antiMLM comment on my post. I did what I’ve been “trained” over the years to do and defended what I was doing because I truly believed in my product and opportunity. That didn’t stop the person from trying to open my eyes and just for the heck of it I went to the antiMLM sub and started reading. At first I became a little angry at the posts I was seeing and even considered writing a heartfelt post explaining to the readers that my company was different and here’s why. I’m so glad I didn’t do that because they would have had a field day with tearing apart all the lies I believed and might not have been compassionate about the cult like brainwashing that I’ve been involved in for so long.

For me to be writing this is scary because I don’t know what I will get for a reaction by the people in this group. I’m hoping that there are other people who drank the Kool-Aid like me that will offer suggestions/advice about leaving a MLM and be mindful that I’m a sensitive human being with feelings that get hurt easily. So please be kind if you choose to comment. I’ve been very hard on myself since learning the truth about MLM’s and I’m not sure if I can handle comments that are purposely hurtful.

At this point with this new found knowledge about MLM’s being a scam, I’m not sure what to do first and what steps to take. I’ve been doing a lot of reading about the lies I believed (about how much money I could make being the biggest)and have started questioning myself and my ability to trust myself. I’m trying not to be hard on myself and beat myself up but not only did I believe in a lie, I transferred my belief onto other people who trusted me and I would never intentionally try to scam or hurt another person.

I consider myself to be an intelligent person and cannot believe how deep I got into this “business model” and way of life. I’m glad I’m learning the truth but I’m wondering about my next steps. I have always been a private person so my Facebook account was limited to people I personally knew. Through the “social media marketing brainwashing” I was taught to make my profile public and get to 5000 friends as fast as I could. I have about 500,and never got to 5000 thank God, but where do I start? Do I go through each person and decide if I have enough in common with them to continue to be friends? I also met several people in MLM’s though the companies I was involved in and different network marketing groups, Do they stay as friends or should it be case by case? Should I call out the people in my MLM and previous MLM’s for scamming me and educate them on MLM reality (that 99% fail) in case they don’t/didn’t know like me? Or do I let it go? 

The thing I believed the most was the money I could make. They were very clever in saying that this person became a 7 figure earner in less than 2 years and with this amazing life changing product, the timing of the industry, and where I got in on the ground floor..why couldn’t I do that too? “No income claims of course” that’s what they’d say after they made the income claim. In my other company I was one of the top recruiters in my district. Now I’m on the ground floor (isn’t that the top? Isn’t that why I failed before..because the company I was with was saturated with distributors.? )This time my dreams are coming true! You should join me too! It wasn’t through my lack of trying. Believe me I tried. I can’t tell you how many hours I worked on “the dream”,or how much money I spent on the convention out of state, or the additional training I took to be a “networking marketing professional”. Wow just writing this sounds crazy! It’s embarrassing now to admit I fell for this predatory scheme but there are so many others that fall prey to this and maybe my story will help someone else get out a lot sooner than I did.

I’m not sure if it’s my personality or what it is but now that I know the truth about MLM’s I want to help other people who have been told lies about the money they can make and the lifestyle they can have it they just don’t give up. I’ve seen some blogs and some videos on YouTube about MLM’s being a scam and wonder if that is something I should do myself to educate other people. Not once did I ever investigate MLM’s being too good to be true. I didn’t know that about 99% didn’t make money or lost money entirely. I got defensive when friends and family asked how much money I was making or questioned me about the time I was investing in my MLM. I’ve learned that getting out of a MLM is like getting out of a cult and I can definitely see the similarities. There were people in my life that were important to me but if they started questioning my involvement with my MLM out of concern I would get defensive and accuse them of not supporting my vision or dream. I’m sure I have friends I have pushed away or they have stepped back because I was either trying to sell to them or recruit them.

So my question is...Where do I go from here? Who do I apologize to first? Do I make a Facebook post apologizing to my friends for trying to sell/recruit them into my MLM? What about the product that changed my life? Do I continue to buy it and just be a customer? What about the people I recruited? Do I let them know the truth and let them make their own decision? I know if someone told me the truth while I was in so deep I wouldn’t believe it and would feel threatened and get defensive. This is definitely tough stuff to decipher and I hope there is someone who has been through this that can shed some light on what I’m experiencing with this new found knowledge that I’ve been living a lie for close to 10 years.

Lastly, where this is such new information for me I haven’t severed ties with my MLM yet and I’m not sure if I want to because of the 1 product that has changed my life. I’m sure if I do some research I can find a comparable product and get done entirely BUT what if this product gets recognized on a large scale? Everyone I know knows I sell it. Could I just sell to customers that want it and not promote it and try to recruit people like I used to. Can I safely just use the product and let people come to me if they want it or am I looking for trouble and deceiving myself with this thought?",50,161,,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/e12eyz/i_recently_realized_that_ive_been_brainwashed_for/

I “did the business” for 2 years, and after only ranking up to Executive, finally decided to leave after reading up about the horrible person Donald Gary Young was.

I was sucked in! Embarrassing.,"This is my MLM story.

I’ve always been against these things. I have always spoken out about how they are pyramid schemes. I’m not really sure how I was so blinded and how I got sucked in but I did. After I had my second child I was looking for ways to make money as a stay at home mom. I had just left my job at Victoria’s Secret and I was really good at customer service and sales. I came across this website called Chloe and Isabel.. (they just recently went out of business, shocker) 

It honestly did not sound like an MLM because there was no mention of recruiting and you did not have to sign up under someone like an up line. There was no mention of commissions from anybody that you did recruit. You did not have to buy any product, either. It was a jewelry business where you bought a starter kit but then you just made commissions off of any purchases made by customers on your website. I thought I would be good at it because I have so much sales experience. I kept telling people this is different because I make 25% commission off of any sales but I don’t have to purchase anything. Win win right? 🙄

This was spring 2017, and I had just got my tax refund so I thought why not pay the $200 for the 15+ pieces of supposedly expensive jewelry and see what happens?! 

So this is how they get you. They tell you that for the first month of your business you get 50% off in the online store, so you can buy as much jewelry as you want and if you want you can resell it at full price and keep the profit yourself. Guys, I think I spent about $1000 in just a couple months. The only real true commissions that I ever earned was probably about $200. And not to mention you guys this jewelry was crap. They had a policy where you could return it at any time and get a replacement for free but that’s because every single piece broke. And I tried talking to my mentor and the other people in my group and they just kept telling me that the company has such a good return policy so it doesn’t matter if it breaks and I’m like yeah it does? Why would a customer want jewelry that breaks? Especially if it’s like $60..

Eventually I stopped after about five months and I ended up selling all of my jewelry on poshmark. I made about $500. It wasn’t a total loss I guess but it definitely made me feel like a failure. I guess I should’ve realized that if you have to buy in, it’s always a scam.",10,64,,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/cpu93w/i_was_sucked_in_embarrassing/

MY Story,"(edit: sorry on mobile formatting is not great)


I got into Youngliving when an old friend from HS started talking to me again. She is actually a pediatric nurse in a big hospital, so when I told her my young son was sick all the time she said “oils”.

She added me to a fb group and introduced me to her upline, they all became my “friends”. They started an fb group called “game plan boot camp” where we had to purchase the ""game plan"" book

We all read a chapter a week and discussed it in the group, and given homework

The book is 💯 about selling a starter kit and creating a down line. In the book we were told to never sell a single oil, and to keep pushing the starter kit so we could make all our dreams come true


Most of the book is about how we are supposed to invite people to ""learn about oils"" classes at our homes. The class was actually just a sales pitch where we were supposed to read the ""script"". The book promised that we would be making at least $150k a year, but it was all up to us and no excuses were allowed.

I ended up purchasing all of the marketing material from that website like the CDs and mailing them out to people with samples. I ended up selling 6 starter kits 

Then after all the sales I made, I started having very bad migraines and I stopped working on young living. It was too much to make it to my full time job and still spend time with my son.

My upline WOULD NOT leave me alone, after all I was their prize stud bringing in more starter kits than anyone else. I would ask them OVER, and OVER to wait for me to get my life together and I would contact THEM... they started messaging my husband on facebook when I wouldn't answer, and texting me ""are we still friends"" and every other guilt trip in the book

Those people I signed up under me did NOT want to sell, I told my upline that but they would not take NO for an answer.

My upline embarrassed me got into the youngliving website found the people who I sold kits to and used the contact info from the site to harass them.


Once I joined anitmLM on reddit i slowly started to realize I had been scammed and lied to. I am super embarrassed for everything I posted on FB, I am still deleting people I don't know from the days of mass requests, and I am too sick to think about how much $$$ I actually lost.

I have also lost all of my ""friends"" that connected with me and pretend to care so much about me and my life. They are all super offended I no longer believe in Young Living.

I no longer get the fake ""how are you doing"" texts anymore and its been nice, but I miss my friend and I just feel used.

Journalist seeking Young Living experiences for UCLA article,"Hi members of /r/MLMRecovery!  The title says it all.

I am an interning journalist at UCLA.  Recently, I discovered that UCLA has an aromatherapy program and that the program uses Young Living essential oils.  As many of you already know, MLMs often target college students, because of their lack of money and experience.  I am EXTREMELY concerned about this being a huge conflict of interest, one that is potentially harmful to students.  

I am writing an article about the subject and would love to interview you on your experience with Young Living: how you were recruited, how long you were involved, how you got out, your thoughts and opinions, etc.  It would be especially awesome if you were recruited on a college campus, or if you hail from the SoCal region.

My goal is to write something that will help shed light on the conflict of interest and, hopefully, protect students who might potentially be falling for MLM pitches delivered to them under the guise of ""education.""

Please help me convince my mother to avoid Chalk Couture!,"Reddit, I really need help with my mom. For almost my entire life I’ve watched her get sucked into pyramid scheme after pyramid scheme. Party light, Mary Kay, health stuff, you name it. It pains and disappoints me and the siblings to watch her go through this again and again.


Recently she sent me a text glowing about how she has finally found a perfect business for her, and how she wants my help setting up a page for it.


Of course, this new business is an MLM, Chalk Couture to be specific (it’s some arts and crafts company. Doesn’t sound devious, but then again neither do clothes or make up!). I had a talk with her, and I tried my best to explain that any business that relies on her bringing in more people isn’t a sustainable, reliable way to make money. She acknowledged that past ventures of hers didn’t pan out, but she then doubled down and insisted that “this one is different” (I’ve heard that before), because 1. The commission structure is generous, and 2. “Because it hasn’t launched in Canada yet (we are Canadian) she will be getting in on the ground floor” this was what made it different from Mary Kay and others in her mind. She really thinks she’s going to be making enough to quit her job, and she has always held on to the dream of “being her own boss” and a “business owner”. 


At the end of our conversation, she agreed to let me take a week to discuss it further and send her articles or videos or write ups etc; She said that if there were any red flags or I could point out anything concerning, she would stop.

I know this isn’t as tragic a story as some of the ones on here, but it breaks my heart. I’m trying to find out what I can about Chalk Couture, but I could really use help. I need help getting past her notion that “being on the ground floor” will make the difference, and I really need help showing her that Chalk Couture is the exact same as other MLMs, and just because it isn’t illegal doesn’t mean it’s not a scam.

I want out of my MLM! Any possibilities for me,"I posted this last night in r/antiMLM, but perhaps my account was too new and it’s auto removed and I guess pending moderator approval. Hopefully this post can get through and r/mlmrecovery can help as well. 

Edit: I can’t edit the title, but I wanted to ask for help/advice concerning buybacks/repurchase by the MLM company.

**Backstory:**
A few years ago, I was looking for opportunities and since I wasn’t working, I was susceptible to joining an MLM company. Shortly after, I got a job and all is well, but I figured I could use the MLM as an “additional source of income”. So I stupidly stayed on for years...until now...and to be honest, over the years I didn’t do much with it. I recently saw a post that said that MLM companies are obligated by the law to buy back products as long as it’s in resellable condition. So as most MLM goes, they require monthly purchases to maintain your status/level in the hierarchy. I guess one good thing about this particular MLM I was a part of is that you don’t have to buy PRODUCTS every month, but just have to put in MONEY every month and then use it whenever you want to purchase something or in bulk or whatever. So basically aside from a few purchases for myself over the years, I still have a stockpile of “money credits” I can use. 

I read through the entire policy procedures and it appears that their buy back policy applies to a particular section for a line of beauty and health products. Basically after you terminate your membership, you have 10 days to make a written request in which the company has to repurchase your items if deemed to be in resellable condition. I’m not sure if I’m in luck, but let’s say I use up all my money credits that have accumulated over the years to get a bunch of these products, then quit the MLM, will be I able to get most of my money back for these products when I return them?! I really want to understand the rules fully before I make such an attempt. 

Additional questions: 

- The MLM company’s main products are in fashion/jewelry. I didn’t see a similar buy back clause for those products, not sure if I just missed it or if it’s because it’s in a different category than beauty/health which have different laws?

- I live in Ontario, Canada, which is the same place as where the MLM is headquartered, and wondering what are the buy back laws for the province? Or laws regarding MLM in general? I read the section concerning MLM/Pyramid Schemes in the Canadian Consumer Handbook, but it doesn’t tell me much. 

- Know any success stories that will give me hope of getting some of my hard earned money back? :)

Thank you so much for reading!! 

P.S. Not sure if I’m allowed to disclose the company name, but if I can, I will amend the post or add to the comments. A paranoid me is worried that if this is truly a loophole I can use to my advantage, will they try to to modify the rules by somehow seeing this post? Haha. Though if you’re a super sleuth, it’s probably not hard to figure out which MLM it is.",6,34,,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/ag5flj/i_want_out_of_my_mlm_any_possibilities_for_me/

I wrote a Dear John to my ex-upline,"Long story short, I recently wrote a letter to my former upline to explain to her why I had been basically No Contact with her for months and why I ultimately quit. It's not quite a Dear John letter since I'd already ""broken up"" with her and the company through its termination process, but it had been eating at me to apologize for the ghosting but to elucidate why I did it. The letter was cathartic for me, but I genuinely hope it can offer some benefit to her too. Of its 742 words, I think this part I am about to share is the notion I most want to get through to her: 

>These are things that I did not feel comfortable sharing with you because I thought you may try to deter me from quitting, and I also did not want to negatively affect your business / your life. **At the same time, though, I felt like I had been duped under the guise of you having legitimate interest in catching up with me and developing our friendship. It did not feel good to realize that your interest in friendship was actually just interest in recruiting me to your downline. I realized this in the initial trainings when I was being taught how to employ the same recruitment methods that had just been used on me.** For some reason, it took me a long while to stop blaming myself for an initial bad decision, assess my situation, and start making better decisions for myself. I did not know the right action to take, so I avoided taking any action ... 

That really is the worst part for me. Yeah I lost money, yeah I probably looked dumb, but it sucked/sucks to ***feel*** dumb for having mistaken a business strategy for a legit friendship. Makes me feel like I was a mark in a con game. I am proud of myself for telling her this, albeit in a letter and after the fact. It took me a while to realize things and come to terms; oh well. It took me a while to muster up the courage to assert this sentiment rather than continue to avoid it/her.

catharsis,"LONG POST

i found the anti-mlm sub a couple weeks ago and it completely changed my life. ive been wanting to tell my story but i’m afraid to get into specifics cuz i dont want the hunbots after me, and i’ve deleted a lot of my posts out of paranoia.

when i was younger i got sucked into amway for about a year, went to a huge conference and saw bill britt, was thoroughly brainwashed. i only got one friend to join underneath me, and honestly i think she just came along for the spectacle. i ended up just buying the stuff for myself for a while and eventually stopped going to meetings and lost interest. i knew something was really weird about amway, it was a cult-like experience. but i felt like a failure cuz i couldnt do well in the business. it was always in the back of my head as something i shamefully failed at (because this is what they brainwash you to think)

fast forward like 7 years to last year, i get sucked into arbonne, thinking this would be another chance. the products are great and you dont have to keep inventory, surely this is Nothing like Amway. Plus we dont have to go to multiple cult meetings per week! wow! what a much better business. HAH. all my amway brainwashing comes back, i know all the catchphrases they throw around, i know all the things that are supposed to make you a good “business owner” or “consultant”. So then i’m right back in the mindset again, 7 or 8 years later. 

im trying not to go off on too many tangets because there’s so much i witnessed and experienced, and ive only recently realized how super fucked up it all was.

i want to tell everyone here about all of the instances of emotional abuse, persistant shaming and guilting i got from my direct upline in arbonne, but im afraid she and the other huns are lurking.

last week when i fell down the anti-mlm rabbit hole, my perception of everything changed. the weight of shame and guilt i’ve been carrying around for 8 years has been lifted off of me. feeling bad about not being a good salesperson or recruiter no longer has to take up space in my head. i wasnt even involved with arbonne anymore besides buying stuff for myself, and i feel like i have a whole brand new life now. (dont worry, they won’t be getting any more of my money)


there was a discussion point i wanted to get to but im having trouble articulating the words. there was a rant in my head about how arbonne makes people prey on the sick, but consultants are brainwashed to think they are improving lives, giving the blessed gift of wellness.
 
i’ll post more when i have the words and my mind isn’t going off in a million directions  thanks for reading

The time I tried to profit off a tragedy,"Sigh. Guys. I was the worst of the worst. My Jamberry business wasn’t growing like I was promised it would, so I was looking for any potential avenue to turn things around. 

One day in early May, a local police officer was shot and killed in the line of duty TWO HOURS before she was going on maternity leave to take home her daughter (who had been very premature and in the NICU for several months). It was absolutely devastating to her family, friends, the police force, and even the community. I genuinely wanted to help, but I also saw that it was a way to get customers. 

I ended up reaching out to the police force and asking if they would promote a fundraiser I was doing for the officer’s family. Pathetically, I was not the first person with Jamberry to reach out. 

I feel so awful and gross about it now. The only thing that makes me feel a tiny bit less bad is that I was genuinely trying to help in some convoluted way and I would have donated 100% of my commission to the cause. But still. That it even crossed my mind as away to get new customers is just freaking awful.

Vector And Cutco,"Thanks for this sub!  I used to sell Cutco.  I was desperate for a job at the time, and I didn’t realize it was an MLM until they overdrafted my account for 300 dollars.   I was under the guise that giving them my bank account information was for direct deposit and they promised me that they weren’t going to charge me anything.  It was a complete scam and I was bullied by the person who was in charge of my group (the upline as I’m now learning) for not making sales.  I never got my money back and I always try and speak out against them.  CUTCO IS A SCAM!!",6,32,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/8gi6kf/vector_and_cutco/
Former PR hun,"In 2014 I was post divorce, living on my own for the first time and I was very active in the local kink scene. Needless to say when I went to a PR party and mentioned this, I was zeroed in on by the consultant. 

I signed up for the cheap kit which I didn’t end up paying for (a friend bought it for me). I did it for a year, made about... I dunno, $500? I had one down line and I made $25 off her. 

What I hated the most was the pressure to constantly post on Facebook. I thought it was tacky and I always felt so fake. I had a design degree, so I’d make my own fliers to be more unique but no one “liked” any of them and I just felt like I was annoying people rather than reaching out. 

I had a few repeat customers which kept me afloat for a while, but doing parties got so annoying. I was all about having a positive outlook on sex and getting women to be more open with their sexuality, but that’s not what the company was about. It was all about getting out of the corporate world and being your own #bossbabe. Fuck that. 

So I fell off the radar and threw out all my old shit. The toys were cheap and I only ever used one lube. 

The cherry on top of this story: my former upline is now doing business coaching. I’ve recently become a personal trainer because fitness is my passion. I figured I’d call her up and see what kind of coaching she offered and if she could help me. I haven’t been a certified trainer for even a year yet so I’m still super new. She tells me we can do a 5hr workshop which included ironing out business strategy, how much I can charge for services, etc etc. I figured for 5 hours it would be a few hundred bucks. No: Two. Thousand. Dollars. 

But then! She said that price is only good until June because she’s going to be a NOMAD and travel so that price will be going to $9000. 

I said no thank you. Haven’t heard from her since. 

I don’t miss MLM at all. ",4,64,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/8ge1dl/former_pr_hun/
PR Huns run my life.,"So one of my boyfriend's close friends sells pure romance. Let's call her Tammy. She got me into it as a bulk discount for my sex toys. I was okay with it, not really pushing it on anyone, not really doing much except ordering every 2 months until I learned that another friend  of mine, Jane, was signed up by her. What really let me know that Tammy was toxic was that she charged Jane for products and then signed her up on her downline after.  I'm so burnt out from trying to help Jane ""launch her business"" and she was literally crying at what a ""failure"" she is. It made me feel like shit (even though I told her how predatory MLMs are before she launched).

How do I help her, and how do I cut ties with Tammy without hurting my man? Note: he is from a military family, most of his relatives do lia sophia, paparazzi, other shitty MLMs. I can't shit on MLMs.",9,40,Story,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/8gd4ab/pr_huns_run_my_life/
